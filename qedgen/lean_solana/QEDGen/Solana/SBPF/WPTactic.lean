/-! ## wp_exec — one-shot sBPF verification

Proves properties of the form:
  (executeFn progAt (initState inputAddr mem) FUEL).exitCode = some CODE

Usage:
  wp_exec [progAt, progAt_0, progAt_1] [ea_0, ea_88]

First bracket: fetch function + chunk defs (passed to dsimp for instruction decode).
Second bracket: effectiveAddr lemmas + extras (passed to simp for branch resolution).

The tactic:
1. Applies executeFn_eq_execSegment to switch to monadic execution
2. Iteratively unfolds execSegment one step at a time (O(1) kernel depth)
3. Uses dsimp to evaluate instruction fetch via kernel reduction
4. Uses simp with hypotheses to resolve branch conditions
5. Closes the halted-state residual via rfl

Example:
  theorem rejects_bad_input ... := by
    have h1 : ¬(readU64 mem inputAddr = EXPECTED) := by ...
    wp_exec [progAt, progAt_0] [ea_0]

/-! ## wp_step — single instruction step (for manual proofs)

Unfolds one level of execSegment, evaluates the instruction via dsimp,
and simplifies with hypotheses. Use when wp_exec needs manual guidance
(e.g., memory disjointness lemmas between steps). -/

/-! ## strip_writes — automatic memory write stripping

Strips nested write layers from read expressions by proving address disjointness
via omega. Pre-unfolds STACK_START so omega sees pure numerals.

Works for both cross-region (input reads through stack writes) and
within-stack (stack reads at different offsets from stack writes).

Usage (after a wp_step that left read-through-write patterns in the goal):
  wp_step [progAt, progAt_0, progAt_1, writeByWidth] [ea_offsets...]
  strip_writes
  simp [h_read_hypothesis, *]

For hypotheses containing wrapAdd/toU64, normalize them first:
  simp [wrapAdd, toU64] at h_addr
  strip_writes

      | rw [readU64_writeU64_same _ _ _ (by first | simp | omega)])))

/-! ## strip_writes_goal — goal-only variant for large contexts

Like strip_writes but only unfolds STACK_START in the goal, not hypotheses.
Use this when the context has many hypotheses (e.g., after 20+ wp_step calls)
and `unfold STACK_START at *` causes timeout. -/

      | rw [readU64_writeU64_same _ _ _ (by first | simp | omega)])))

/-! ## rewrite_mem — rewrite memory chain + frame

Rewrites with a chain of memory hypotheses, then applies region-based
frame reasoning to strip write layers from read expressions.

Usage:
  rewrite_mem [hmem]

is equivalent to:
  rw [hmem]; mem_frame

/-! ## solve_read — one-shot memory read resolution

to strip write layers, then closes the goal with `exact`.

  solve_read [hmem] h_val
