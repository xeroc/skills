-- Region-based memory frame for sBPF verification
--
-- sBPF memory is partitioned into regions (input < stack < heap).
-- Writes to one region don't affect reads from another.
--
-- This module provides:
--   1. Chain frame lemmas: strip N writes in one shot
--   2. The `mem_frame` tactic: automatic region-based write stripping
--
-- The key optimization over strip_writes: mem_frame pre-unfolds STACK_START
-- once and uses two-premise frame lemmas (h_r + h_w) instead of trying
-- 20+ lemma alternatives with omega for each write layer.

/-! ## mem_frame tactic

Strips write layers from read expressions using region separation.

Two modes:
1. **Below-above** (most common): read from input region (< STACK_START),
   write to stack (≥ STACK_START). Uses two-premise frame lemmas.
2. **Within-stack**: read and write both in stack at different offsets.
   Falls back to standard disjointness lemmas.

Key optimization: unfolds STACK_START once at the start instead of
per-alternative, then all omega calls work on pure numerals. -/
