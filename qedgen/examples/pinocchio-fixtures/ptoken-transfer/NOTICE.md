# NOTICE

This fixture is **synthesized** Rust source matching the patterns
documented in `docs/prds/PRD-v2.19-pinocchio-audit.md`. It is NOT a
vendored copy of upstream code.

Pattern inspiration: Solana Foundation's
[`solana-program/token/pinocchio`](https://github.com/solana-program/token/tree/main/pinocchio)
(Apache-2.0). The shapes of `process_transfer`'s unchecked loads,
SAFETY comments, and arithmetic mirror the upstream design; no source
text is copied.

If a future v2.19.x patch vendors upstream source verbatim, this file
will be updated with the upstream commit hash and full attribution.
