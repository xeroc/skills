-- v2.28 — bundled SPL Token proof package (explicit-axiom shape).
--
-- WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS NOT. These are NOT proofs that the deployed SPL
-- Token program honors the `ensures` clauses declared in
-- `crates/qedgen/data/interfaces/spl_token.qedspec`. They are
-- AXIOMATIZED contracts. The package's load-bearing guarantee is the
-- `binary_hash` content pin against the deployed program at
-- `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` — `verify
-- --check-upstream` re-dumps and compares. Nothing in this module
-- proves that those pinned bytes implement the contracts below.
--
-- v2.28 — explicit-axiom rename. v2.27 wrapped each axiom in a one-step
-- `theorem ensures_axiom_<i> := runtime_trust_<binder>` indirection.
-- That made `#print axioms` on consumer proofs report `runtime_trust_*`
-- by name (one level removed from the symbol the consumer references)
-- and visually framed the package as "proven." Both are now dropped:
-- each `ensures_axiom_<i>` is declared as a top-level `axiom` directly,
-- so the unverified trust surface appears under exactly the symbol
-- consumers apply. Consumer code (`exact Token.transfer.ensures_axiom_0
-- pre post amount (·.field)`) is byte-identical across v2.27 and v2.28.
--
-- v3.0+ (Stance 3) — when QEDGen/qedsvm ships per-handler separation-
-- logic specs + a `qedsvm_discharge` tactic, each `axiom
-- ensures_axiom_<i>` below becomes `theorem ensures_axiom_<i> ... := by
-- qedsvm_discharge "<binary_hash>" "<handler>"`. The tactic decodes the
-- ELF at `binary_hash`, applies the bundled SL spec via `sl_block_auto`,
-- and projects onto the abstract State accessor. Consumer code remains
-- unchanged through that transition.
