//! Bootstrap a skeleton `Proofs.lean` (once) and check for orphan/missing
//! theorems on every `qedgen check`.
//!
//! `Spec.lean` is regenerated from the `.qedspec` every run. `Proofs.lean`
//! is user-owned — it holds preservation theorems with user-written tactic
//! scripts. The two talk to each other through theorem names: if the spec
//! drops a handler, the theorem referencing it goes stale; if the spec
//! adds a handler to `preserved_by`, a theorem is missing. Both surface
//! as check-time diagnostics.
