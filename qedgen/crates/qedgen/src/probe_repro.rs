//! `qedgen probe` reproducer construction pipeline.
//!
//! Implements the v2.16 contract: every emitted `Finding` carries a
//! concrete `Reproducer` (Kani trace, proptest seed, or sandbox tx) the
//! user can re-run deterministically. Findings whose reproducer cannot
//! be constructed are **silently dropped** — there is no advisory tier.
//!
//! ## Pipeline shape
//!
//! `run_probe` collects candidate findings from each `predicate_*` fn in
//! `probe.rs` (each with `reproducer: None`), then runs every candidate
//! through `construct_reproducer`. The dispatcher routes by
//! `finding.category` to a per-category constructor that:
//!
//! 1. Builds a Mollusk-driven Rust integration test, Kani harness, or
//!    proptest seed from the spec slice the predicate flagged.
//! 2. Executes it (within `ctx.kani_budget`).
//! 3. Captures the counterexample / failing seed / observed violation.
//! 4. Writes reproducer artifacts under `target/qedgen-repros/<finding.id>/`
//!    — **ephemeral, never committed** (regenerated every probe run; see
//!    PLAN-v2.16 D3).
//! 5. Returns a `Reproducer` whose `invocation` field re-runs the artifact.
//!
//! On any failure (timeout, no counterexample found, build error) the
//! constructor returns `Err(ConstructFailure::*)` and the candidate
//! finding is dropped.
//!
//! ## Why drop-on-fail
//!
//! Per `feedback_probes_reproducible_only.md`: lint pattern matches
//! without a reproducer are auditor-grade noise — users have lived with
//! generic warnings and don't act. A finding with no reproducer also
//! can't defend against "we don't think that's reachable." If a Kani
//! harness times out, the bug *might* exist but we have no evidence:
//! silent is more honest than "possibly vulnerable."
//!
//! ## v2.16 ship status — D3 deferred to v3
//!
//! v2.16 ships this module's **scaffolding only**: the dispatcher,
//! the `ConstructFailure` enum, and per-category constructor stubs
//! that all return `Err(ConstructFailure::NotImplemented)`. The
//! actual per-category file-writing constructors **do not ship in
//! v2.16** — PLAN-v2.16's D3 was deferred to v3 after design review
//! concluded the mechanical-template approach trades too much
//! codegen-bug surface for too little file content (see
//! `feedback_repros_agent_authored.md`).
//!
//! v3's design replaces these constructors with **agent-authored
//! repros via structured prompts** — `qedgen probe` emits a
//! `pending_repros[]` list with one prompt per finding; the
//! in-session agent reads each prompt and writes the test file
//! directly via the Write tool. The dispatcher and stubs in this
//! file get reworked or removed at that point.
//!
//! Until v3 lands: every probe finding is silently dropped under the
//! reproducible-only contract (no constructor produces a real
//! reproducer). This is the correct user-visible behavior. The
//! auditor SKILL (D5) provides an end-to-end path today by writing
//! Mollusk repros directly via Write tool, bypassing this dispatcher.
