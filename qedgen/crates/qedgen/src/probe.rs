//! `qedgen probe` — spec-coverage gap analyzer.
//!
//! Walks a parsed `.qedspec` and emits structured findings describing
//! categories the spec is silent on. Output is JSON, consumed by the
//! harness-native auditor subagent (CI / non-agent users can read the
//! same JSON directly). The CLI does **not** read implementation source
//! — that's the auditor's job. Predicates here are runtime-agnostic
//! (operate on the spec) by design; per-runtime spec-less predicates
//! live in the auditor SKILL.md.
//!
//! Spec-aware categories: `missing_signer`, `arbitrary_cpi`,
//! `arithmetic_overflow_wrapping`, `lifecycle_one_shot_violation`,
//! `unbounded_amount_param`, `permissionless_state_writer`,
//! `init_without_pda`, `stored_field_never_written`. Each is a
//! *compose-able primitive* — the
//! auditor subagent chains them into kill-chains (see SKILL.md
//! "Compose-with-what cookbook"). Spec-less / impl-side categories
//! (`cpi_param_swap`, `pda_canonical_bump`, `account_type_confusion`,
//! `close_account_redirection`, `oracle_staleness`, etc.) live in
//! the auditor SKILL.md per-runtime predicates — they need source
//! reading the CLI doesn't do.
