# Release v2.19.0 — Pinocchio probe, Miri verify, scaffold-to-spec interview

v2.19 lands two complementary additions to QEDGen's brownfield audit
surface:

1. **Pinocchio runtime probe** (`qedgen probe --program <root>`) that
   enumerates `unsafe`-serde and arithmetic sites in Pinocchio
   programs, parses adjacent `// SAFETY:` comments, and maps each site
   to a candidate finding with both Mollusk and Miri repro prompts.
   The auditor subagent expands the prompts into runnable tests.
2. **Miri verify backend** (`qedgen verify --miri`) that runs Pinocchio
   repros under `cargo +nightly miri test` and surfaces UB / aliasing /
   overflow plus dual-execution divergence against Mollusk as Critical.
3. **Scaffold-to-spec interview** — the brownfield value-delivery lever
   that ties them together. One CLI dance: scan a Solana program,
   cluster findings into ≤10 candidate spec clauses, ratify via
   markdown interview, emit `<program>.qedspec` + rejected-clause
   scoping notes + bug-flagged finding files. Covers all four runtimes
   (Pinocchio, Anchor, Quasar, Native — Native ships as preview).

## What's in

### Pinocchio probe surface (M1 of the Pinocchio audit work)

`crates/qedgen/src/pinocchio_probe.rs` walks every `*.rs` under the
project's `src/` and enumerates 10 site kinds:

- `BorrowUnchecked` — `*.borrow_*_unchecked*()`
- `BytemuckCall` — `bytemuck::(from|try_from|cast)*<T>`
- `RawPtrCastFromAccount` — raw `as *const _` / `transmute` on account data
- `CustomLoadCall` — `load*` fn inside `unsafe { }` with `_unchecked` first arg
- `TryIntoUnwrapOnSlice` — `_[..].try_into().unwrap()`
- `SetLamportsArith` — `set_lamports(...)` / `*lamports {+/-}= _`
- `SetAmountArith` — `set_amount(amount() {+/-} _)`
- `IndexedAccountAccess` — `accounts[N]` literal
- `IndexedDataSlice` — `data[CONST..CONST{+/-}N]`
- `SafetyComment` — `// SAFETY:` blocks attached to the next `unsafe { }` scope

Each site maps to a `Finding` with two reproducer prompts
(`MolluskPrompt` + `MiriPrompt`). The MiriPrompt carries
`adversarial_inputs` derived from the SAFETY comment's parsed clauses
(`uninit_init_flag`, `foreign_owner`, `swap_position`, etc.) plus
`invariant_asserts` the agent brackets the handler call with.

`Reproducer::MolluskPrompt` and `Reproducer::MiriPrompt` are new
v2.19 variants on the `Reproducer` enum. Both carry
`template_path`, `substitutions: BTreeMap<String, String>`, and
`repro_path` — the agent reads the template, expands substitutions,
and writes the filled repro to disk.

Three fixture programs under `examples/pinocchio-fixtures/`:
`pata-create`, `ptoken-close-account`, `ptoken-transfer`. Each
mirrors a real Pinocchio shape (synthesized, not vendored — see
each fixture's `NOTICE.md`).

### Miri verify backend (M2 of the Pinocchio audit work)

`crates/qedgen/src/miri_verify.rs` discovers
`.qed/probes/pinocchio/*/repro_miri.rs` under the project root,
shells `cargo +nightly miri test`, and parses output for UB /
aliasing / overflow / `SAFETY claim STALE` markers into structured
`MiriDiagnostic`s. Each diagnostic surfaces as a finding through the
existing `verify` envelope.

**Dual-execution divergence detection.** When a Pinocchio repro fails
under Miri but the corresponding Mollusk repro passes, that's a
release-mode wrap + sBPF-alignment masking signal. Surfaced as
`Category::ExecutionDivergence` (Critical) — the deployed `.so` runs
under-detected UB that the host Miri interpreter exposes.

CLI: `qedgen verify --miri` (alone or alongside `--proptest` /
`--kani` / `--lean`). With no backend flags, the auto-detect path now
picks up `--miri` if `.qed/probes/pinocchio/*/repro_miri.rs` files
exist on disk.

`qedgen probe --program <root>` runtime-detects Pinocchio
automatically (presence of `pinocchio` Cargo dep). Override with
`--runtime pinocchio` if detection fails.

### Scaffold-to-spec interview (M1-M4 of the interview work)

The brownfield bear-hug. One command per phase:

```bash
# Phase 1: scan + cluster + write the interview prompts
qedgen probe --program <root> --emit-spec-candidates \
  --audit-dir .qed/audit/<timestamp>

# Phase 2: user edits .qed/audit/<timestamp>/interview.md
# Each cluster has 4 markdown checkboxes: accept / narrow / reject / bug

# Phase 3: ratify into a .qedspec + side-files
qedgen ratify --audit-dir .qed/audit/<timestamp> \
  --out <program>.qedspec
```

What the audit dir contains after Phase 1:
- `interview.md` — markdown prompts, one section per cluster,
  organized by confidence (High → Medium → Low)
- `clusters.json` — schema-v3 envelope: full cluster metadata,
  finding back-references, suggested syntax, write-routing
- `skeleton.qedspec` — pre-interview structural skeleton (handler
  stubs only; semantic clauses come from the interview)

What ratify writes:
- `<program>.qedspec` — skeleton + ratified clauses merged in
  (program-scope invariants emitted as
  `invariant N "description"` — description-form, parser-valid;
  handler-scope clauses as structured `// TODO ratified (...)` markers
  with `// Target form: ...` lines pointing at the parseable shape)
- `.qed/plan/scoping.md` — rejected clusters with user rationale
- `.qed/findings/scaffold-to-spec-<cluster_id>.md` — one file per
  bug-flagged cluster (the user identified the implicit precondition
  as a real missing-enforcement bug, not a spec gap)

**14 cluster kinds** (universal across runtimes — `account_owner_check`,
`account_init_check`, `account_signer_check`, `account_type_tag_check`,
`account_distinct`, `arithmetic_no_overflow`, `arithmetic_bound_pre`,
`pda_canonical_derivation`, `pda_seed_uniqueness`,
`lifecycle_one_shot`, `lifecycle_monotonic`, `cpi_program_pin`,
`cpi_account_direction`, `dispatch_caller_establishes_callee_requires`).
Per-runtime extractors map detected site shapes to cluster kinds;
clustering algorithm and prompts/spec emission are runtime-agnostic.

**Promotion threshold:** when ≥3 handlers contribute proto-clauses of
the same kind, the cluster is promoted from Handler-scope to
Program-scope (consolidates the question, surfaces as a candidate
program-wide invariant). Stable, deterministic cluster IDs across re-runs.

**Property tests** for every cluster kind × scope combination: the
emitted spec is parser-validated through `chumsky_adapter::parse_str`.
Ratification is byte-idempotent — re-running on the same audit dir
produces the same spec.

#### Runtime coverage

| Runtime | Extractor | Skeleton | Patterns covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pinocchio | `pinocchio_extractor.rs` | `pinocchio_to_spec.rs` (`pub fn process_*` walk) | SAFETY-comment classification, `_unchecked` loads, `set_amount`/`set_lamports` arith, bytemuck/raw-cast type confusion |
| Anchor | `anchor_extractor.rs` | `anchor_adapt::adapt` (IDL-driven) | `AccountInfo`/`UncheckedAccount` escape hatches, `#[account(seeds=…)]` without `bump`, raw `+-*/` in handler bodies (skipping `#[account(space=…)]` macro context), `init_if_needed` |
| Quasar | Routes through `anchor_extractor` | `anchor_adapt::adapt` | Inherited from Anchor; Quasar-specific drift detection deferred to future |
| **Native (preview)** | `native_extractor.rs` | `pinocchio_to_spec::render_skeleton_native` (any `pub fn`) | `invoke_signed` without nearby program-ID pin, `Pubkey::create_program_address`, raw arith, `**try_borrow_mut_lamports()? OP x` lamport demotion |

**Native is marked preview.** Coverage is narrower than Anchor's
because Native has no framework conventions — every check is the
author's responsibility, and syntactic detection is conservatively
false-negative-biased to keep FP rate manageable. Manual signer-check
absence, owner-check absence, and discriminator collision remain
covered at the auditor SKILL.md layer (Read+Grep on the impl, not in
the CLI extractor).

#### Schema v3 — backwards-compatible envelope extension

The probe envelope's new `clusters[]` field appears only when
`--emit-spec-candidates` is passed. v2-shape consumers without that
flag see the unchanged envelope. Cluster schema documented in the
SCOPING-v2.19-scaffold-to-spec.md design doc.

### Auditor §3c — Trust-surface dep walk

Third cross-cutting walk added to the auditor SKILL alongside the
existing 3a (coverage-of-safe-utility) and 3b (per-role
identity-anchoring) passes. Runs only when the program leans on a
small security-critical dep (signature schemes, ZK verifiers, VRFs,
commitments, hand-rolled hash constructions). Recognition gate:
small/niche dep whose API surface includes verb-shaped names
(`sign`, `verify`, `prove`, `commit`, `recover_pubkey`,
`verify_proof`, `aggregate`), program README cites the primitive
by name as a security feature, and tests exercise the program
rather than the primitive directly. Widely-deployed deps
(`solana-program`, `spl-token`, `anchor-lang`, `pinocchio`,
`solana-sdk`, `mollusk-svm`) stay trust-boundary axioms.

Workflow: locate the trust claim from the dep's docs → list failure
modes for the primitive's class (via the new
`skills/qedgen-auditor/references/trust_surface_primitives.md` —
per-class checklists for hash-based OTS, Schnorr/EdDSA, BLS,
threshold sigs, Pedersen/KZG, Merkle, ZK verifiers, VRFs, custom
hash constructions) → open the dep's source and compare scheme
against canonical reference → flag any structural delta or surface
as inconclusive. The references file accretes one class per
novel-primitive audit; the SKILL itself encodes only the
class-agnostic process.

Catches bugs in primitives the program treats as axiomatic. The
program may be 100% correct against the catalog and the 3a/3b
walks while still being drainable because the library it trusts
is broken at the algorithmic level (e.g., signature schemes
missing checksum digits, commitments without binding under the
chosen hash, ZK verifiers that accept malleable proofs).

## Migration

No breaking changes — every addition is additive behind opt-in flags.

- Existing probe runs without `--emit-spec-candidates` are unchanged.
- Existing `qedgen verify` runs without `--miri` skip the Miri backend.
- The auditor SKILL.md (`skills/qedgen-auditor/SKILL.md` +
  `.claude/skills/qedgen-auditor/SKILL.md`) has a new step 6 that
  documents the interview flow; the legacy silent-scaffold path still
  applies for sBPF / exotic runtimes the extractor doesn't cover.
- Auditor §3c trust-surface dep walk runs only when the recognition
  gate fires (small/niche security-critical dep). Audits on programs
  whose security model rests entirely on widely-deployed framework
  deps skip §3c at zero cost.

## Pre-release validation

- `cargo fmt --check` ✓
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` ✓
- `cargo test --release` — 643 passes, 0 failures, 8 ignored.
- `bash scripts/check-readme-drift.sh` ✓
- Bundled examples (`examples/rust/escrow/qed.lock` etc.) — checked
  against current spec via `qedgen check --frozen`.
- End-to-end dogfood: pre-fix `p-token` (`cf136e7^`) — 99 findings
  cluster into 6 candidate clauses → user bug-flags the
  asymmetric-disclosed `owner_locked_writes` cluster → finding file
  captures the cf136e7 disclosure with user rationale + 20
  cross-referenced finding IDs.

## What's not in v2.19

The original SCOPING doc called for a full AST-to-qedspec serializer
in M2; we punted it during execution after discovering the M1 text-based
ratify is byte-idempotent and produces parser-clean output. Defers to
the first release where Anchor/Native extractors need to mutate
existing user-written specs (vs. appending to skeletons) — currently
no such use case has surfaced.

Native extractor's manual-signer-check and manual-owner-check
detection (the patterns where syntactic detection requires data-flow
analysis) remain at the auditor SKILL.md / Read+Grep layer. Promotes
to extractor-coverage when we have a real-world signal that the
agent-layer is missing them.
