# Phase-2 interview examples — `AskUserQuestion` transcripts

These are example `AskUserQuestion` transcripts the auditor fires in
Phase 2 of an audit (after the first reproducible MED+ has surfaced —
see `workflow_walkthrough.md`). The agent has internal invariant /
state-machine / authority-graph / threat-model hypotheses from Phase
1's read pass; this file shows how to surface them as TUI questions
for user ratification.

Each transcript shows the same four-batch shape:

1. **Invariants** (multi-select) — 5–7 candidate invariants with code
   `preview` per option.
2. **State machine shape** (single-select) — archetype with struct +
   handler-signature preview.
3. **Authority graph** (multi-select) — extracted roles with `Signer`
   constraint preview per option.
4. **Threat scenarios + intentional gaps** (mixed: single-select on
   attacker model, multi-select on shortcuts).

Question shape matches the harness `AskUserQuestion` tool: each
question has `question`, `header` (≤12 chars), `multiSelect: bool`,
and `options: [{label, description, preview?}, …]`. JSON below is
compact for the doc; the agent constructs the array client-side.

## Transcript 1 — Authority-gated vault (one-shot init, single admin)

**Scene:** vault program with admin-controlled fee parameters. Single
`State` PDA, three handlers (`initialize`, `update_fee`, `withdraw`).

**Phase 1 produced:**
- MED — `arithmetic_no_overflow` in `withdraw`: `amount * fee_bps / 10_000`
  overflows for `amount ≥ 2^56` (Mollusk repro fired).
- LOW — `account_owner_check` missing on `fee_recipient`.

### Batch 1 — Invariants

```json
{ "question": "Which invariants must always hold?", "header": "Invariants", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "fee_bps ≤ 10_000", "description": "Fee bps never exceed 100%.",
    "preview": "pub struct State { pub admin: Pubkey, pub fee_bps: u16, pub vault_balance: u64, pub initialized: bool }" },
  { "label": "vault_balance == Σ deposits − Σ withdrawals", "description": "Conservation: on-chain balance matches accounting.",
    "preview": "// withdraw: state.vault_balance = state.vault_balance.checked_sub(amount)?;" },
  { "label": "initialized is monotonic (false → true, never back)", "description": "One-shot init.",
    "preview": "require!(!ctx.accounts.state.initialized, ErrorCode::AlreadyInit);" },
  { "label": "admin pubkey is immutable after init", "description": "No handler rotates admin.",
    "preview": "// admin = assigned only in initialize(); no update_admin handler" },
  { "label": "withdraw amount ≤ vault_balance", "description": "No over-withdrawal.",
    "preview": "require!(amount <= state.vault_balance, ErrorCode::Insufficient);" },
  { "label": "fee_recipient mint == vault mint", "description": "Mint match on transfers.",
    "preview": "// (no constraint found; auditor-inferred candidate)" },
  { "label": "Other (free text)", "description": "Add an invariant the auditor missed." }
] }
```

**User clicks:** 1, 2, 3, 5. (Skips immutable-admin: rotation handler
planned. Skips mint-match: enforced upstream.)

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A re-prioritizes overflow / underflow
probes against the ratified `vault_balance` conservation; every effect
touching `vault_balance` must preserve it under `amount ≤ balance`.
Unratified mint-match dropped from spec-candidate emission.

### Batch 2 — State machine shape

```json
{ "question": "Which lifecycle shape matches this program's State?", "header": "Lifecycle", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
  { "label": "One-shot init", "description": "Initialize once; no teardown / re-init.",
    "preview": "pub struct State { ..., pub initialized: bool }\n\nfn initialize(...) -> Result<()>\nfn update_fee(...) -> Result<()>\nfn withdraw(...) -> Result<()>" },
  { "label": "Monotonic lifecycle (init → active → closed)", "description": "Ordered stages; never backwards." },
  { "label": "Oscillating state (e.g. paused ↔ active)", "description": "Reversible transitions." },
  { "label": "Free-form / no lifecycle", "description": "Handlers operate independently." }
] }
```

**User clicks:** "One-shot init."

**Phase 3 effect:** auditor asserts `initialized` monotonicity; any
handler whose effect can clear `initialized` becomes a fired finding.

### Batch 3 — Authority graph

```json
{ "question": "Which authority roles exist?", "header": "Authorities", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "admin — sole authority for parameter updates", "description": "Signs fee/config changes.",
    "preview": "#[account(mut, has_one = admin)] pub state: Account<'info, State>,\npub admin: Signer<'info>," },
  { "label": "user — unprivileged signer for withdraw", "description": "Any signer can withdraw their own funds.",
    "preview": "fn withdraw(ctx: Context<Withdraw>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> { /* no admin signer required */ }" },
  { "label": "fee_recipient — receiving wallet, doesn't sign", "description": "Passive role.",
    "preview": "pub fee_recipient: Account<'info, TokenAccount>," }
] }
```

**User clicks:** admin + user.

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer B's authority sweep treats `withdraw` as
intentionally permissionless and stops emitting "missing signer"
candidates against it. Any handler mutating `fee_bps` without
`admin: Signer` becomes a HIGH finding.

### Batch 4 — Threat scenarios + intentional gaps

```json
[
  { "question": "What attacker model?", "header": "Threat", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
    { "label": "Unprivileged attacker, no signers", "description": "Worst-case caller has no admin / authority signature." },
    { "label": "Compromised user signer", "description": "Attacker can sign as any individual user." },
    { "label": "Compromised authority", "description": "Attacker controls the admin keypair." },
    { "label": "No specific threat model", "description": "Pre-launch hardening; surface anything." }
  ] },
  { "question": "Intentional shortcuts not to flag?", "header": "Shortcuts", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
    { "label": "Admin can rug (drain via fee_bps = 10_000)", "description": "Privileged role trusted by design." },
    { "label": "No reentrancy guard on CPI to token program", "description": "Trusting upstream isolation." },
    { "label": "No price-oracle staleness check", "description": "Out of scope." }
  ] }
]
```

**User clicks:** attacker = "Unprivileged attacker, no signers";
shortcuts = "Admin can rug."

**Phase 3 effect:** admin-rug shortcut suppresses `fee_bps = 10_000`
as a finding. Producer A focuses remaining budget on no-signer paths
— `withdraw` arithmetic, anonymous reentrancy, PDA derivation,
owner-check on `fee_recipient`.

---

## Transcript 2 — Token-program-like (three authorities, no lifecycle)

**Scene:** SPL-token-shaped program. Each `Mint` carries optional
`mint_authority`, `freeze_authority`, `close_authority`. Handlers:
`mint_to`, `burn`, `transfer`, `freeze_account`, `thaw_account`,
`close_account`, `set_authority`.

**Phase 1 produced:**
- HIGH — `account_signer_check` mismatch on `set_authority`: handler
  reads `current_authority` from the account but doesn't enforce it
  as `Signer<'info>` (Miri repro fired).

### Batch 1 — Invariants

```json
{ "question": "Which invariants must hold?", "header": "Invariants", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "supply == Σ account.amount across this mint", "description": "Conservation across mint/burn/transfer.",
    "preview": "pub struct Mint { pub supply: u64, pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>, ... }" },
  { "label": "freeze_authority == None ⇒ no account can be frozen", "description": "Disabled-by-construction freeze.",
    "preview": "if mint.freeze_authority.is_none() { return err!(NoFreezeAuthority); }" },
  { "label": "set_authority(MintTokens) requires current mint_authority as signer", "description": "Authority transitions signed by current holder.",
    "preview": "fn set_authority(ctx: Context<SetAuthority>, ty: AuthorityType, new: COption<Pubkey>) -> Result<()>" },
  { "label": "mint_authority cleared to None is permanent", "description": "Disabled mint is one-way.",
    "preview": "// pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>" },
  { "label": "Token amount never underflows (u64)", "description": "Burn/transfer cannot underflow.",
    "preview": "account.amount = account.amount.checked_sub(amount).ok_or(...)?;" },
  { "label": "close_account requires amount == 0", "description": "Cannot close non-empty account.",
    "preview": "require!(account.amount == 0, ErrorCode::NonEmpty);" },
  { "label": "Other (free text)", "description": "Add what auditor missed." }
] }
```

**User clicks:** all six.

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A schedules conservation harness across
every (`mint_to`, `burn`, `transfer`) tuple under the ratified supply
invariant; the disabled-freeze invariant becomes a fired-finding
target if any handler can set `freeze_authority` non-None after clear.

### Batch 2 — State machine shape

```json
{ "question": "Which lifecycle best matches each Mint?", "header": "Lifecycle", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
  { "label": "One-shot init", "description": "Mint created once and never changes shape." },
  { "label": "Monotonic lifecycle — capabilities only ratchet down", "description": "Authorities can be revoked (→ None) but not granted from None.",
    "preview": "pub struct Mint { pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>, pub freeze_authority: COption<Pubkey>, pub close_authority: COption<Pubkey> }\n// set_authority: Some → Some, Some → None; never None → Some" },
  { "label": "Oscillating state", "description": "Authorities can flip back and forth." },
  { "label": "Free-form", "description": "No coherent state machine." }
] }
```

**User clicks:** "Monotonic lifecycle — capabilities only ratchet down."

**Phase 3 effect:** auditor asserts each `*_authority` field as a
monotone-revocation lattice (`Some(_) ⊑ None`). Any code path mapping
`None → Some(_)` becomes a CRIT-shaped target — for `MintTokens`,
`FreezeAccount`, and `CloseAccount` alike.

### Batch 3 — Authority graph

```json
{ "question": "Which authority roles exist?", "header": "Authorities", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "mint_authority — can mint new tokens", "description": "Signs MintTo.",
    "preview": "#[account(constraint = mint.mint_authority == COption::Some(authority.key()))]\npub mint: Account<'info, Mint>, pub authority: Signer<'info>," },
  { "label": "freeze_authority — can freeze/thaw token accounts", "description": "Signs Freeze/Thaw.",
    "preview": "fn freeze_account(...) -> Result<()> { /* checks mint.freeze_authority == authority.key() */ }" },
  { "label": "close_authority — can close a token account", "description": "Signs CloseAccount.",
    "preview": "fn close_account(...) -> Result<()> { /* checks account.close_authority */ }" },
  { "label": "account_owner — transfer/approve out of own account", "description": "Per-account owner signer.",
    "preview": "#[account(mut, has_one = owner)] pub source: Account<'info, TokenAccount>, pub owner: Signer<'info>," },
  { "label": "delegate — approved-amount-bounded transfer authority", "description": "Signs transfers up to approved amount.",
    "preview": "if account.delegate == COption::Some(authority.key()) && account.delegated_amount >= amount { ... }" }
] }
```

**User clicks:** all five.

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer B builds a 5-row authority × handler
matrix; any handler whose effect doesn't consume the ratified
authority for that row becomes an authority-confusion candidate. The
fired HIGH on `set_authority` maps to row 1.

### Batch 4 — Threat scenarios + intentional gaps

```json
[
  { "question": "Which attacker model?", "header": "Threat", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
    { "label": "Unprivileged attacker, no signers", "description": "Most paranoid; zero captured keys." },
    { "label": "Compromised user signer", "description": "Attacker holds arbitrary token-account owner key." },
    { "label": "Compromised authority", "description": "Attacker holds a mint/freeze/close authority key." },
    { "label": "No specific threat model" }
  ] },
  { "question": "Intentional shortcuts not to flag?", "header": "Shortcuts", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
    { "label": "mint_authority can inflate supply arbitrarily", "description": "By design." },
    { "label": "close_authority can withdraw rent", "description": "Rent goes to close_authority destination by design." },
    { "label": "Delegate-amount race (front-running approve/transfer)", "description": "Known issue, out of scope." }
  ] }
]
```

**User clicks:** attacker = "Compromised user signer"; shortcuts =
"mint_authority can inflate supply" + "Delegate-amount race."

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A upgrades `account_owner`-gated probes
to "fired = HIGH at minimum" — an attacker who holds a user key can
already do the legitimate thing; the audit cares about what they
shouldn't. The delegate-race shortcut suppresses
`arithmetic_no_overflow` on `delegated_amount`.

## Transcript 3 — Lifecycle-heavy position state machine

**Scene:** lending-protocol-like program. Each user `Position` moves
through `Pending → Active → {Closed, Liquidated}`. Handlers:
`open_position`, `add_collateral`, `borrow`, `repay`, `close_position`,
`liquidate`. 4-variant `PositionState`; multiple handler-arrow paths.

**Phase 1 produced:**
- MED — `state_machine_no_skip` on `liquidate`: handler can transition
  `Pending → Liquidated` directly, skipping `Active`. Mollusk repro
  shows a never-funded `Pending` position "liquidated" with zero
  seizure (state corruption, no value extraction yet).

This transcript shows the state-machine question **enriched** —
because the agent saw a 4-variant enum, the option list presents
candidate transition graphs rather than the fixed archetype list.

### Batch 1 — Invariants

```json
{ "question": "Which invariants must hold?", "header": "Invariants", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "collateral * COLL_FACTOR ≥ debt (solvency)", "description": "Position over-collateralized while Active.",
    "preview": "pub struct Position { pub state: PositionState, pub collateral: u64, pub debt: u64, ... }\n// borrow: require!(position.collateral * COLL_FACTOR >= position.debt + amount * price);" },
  { "label": "Σ(position.debt over Active) == pool.total_borrowed", "description": "Pool-level conservation of borrows.",
    "preview": "// borrow: pool.total_borrowed = pool.total_borrowed.checked_add(amount)?;" },
  { "label": "Σ(position.collateral) == pool.total_collateral", "description": "Pool-level conservation of collateral." },
  { "label": "liquidation seizes ≥ debt-equivalent in collateral", "description": "Liquidator receives ≥ 1.0× debt (often + bonus).",
    "preview": "let seize = position.debt * (LIQ_BONUS + ONE) / price; transfer(seize);" },
  { "label": "Transitions follow Pending → Active → {Closed, Liquidated} only", "description": "No skips, no backward.",
    "preview": "pub enum PositionState { Pending, Active, Closed, Liquidated }" },
  { "label": "Active → Closed only when debt == 0", "description": "Cannot close with outstanding debt.",
    "preview": "require!(position.debt == 0, ErrorCode::OutstandingDebt);" },
  { "label": "Other (free text)" }
] }
```

**User clicks:** all six.

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A schedules Kani harnesses for solvency
on every handler mutating `collateral` or `debt` (4-handler × 2-field
= 8 obligations). Producer B runs the pool-conservation cross-handler
sweep. The Phase-1 MED maps directly to "transitions follow … only."

### Batch 2 — State machine shape (enriched options)

```json
{ "question": "Which transition graph is intended?", "header": "Lifecycle", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
  { "label": "Pending → Active → Closed; Active → Liquidated", "description": "Open → Pending; first deposit activates; repay-to-zero closes; under-collateral mid-Active can be liquidated.",
    "preview": "pub enum PositionState { Pending, Active, Closed, Liquidated }\nfn open_position(...)  // → Pending\nfn add_collateral(...) // Pending → Active (first deposit) or Active → Active\nfn borrow(...)         // Active → Active\nfn repay(...)          // Active → Active or → Closed (if debt cleared)\nfn liquidate(...)      // Active → Liquidated\nfn close_position(...) // Active → Closed" },
  { "label": "Pending → {Active, Closed}; Active → {Closed, Liquidated}", "description": "Also allows abandoning a never-funded Pending via close_position.",
    "preview": "// same struct; close_position permitted from Pending iff collateral == 0" },
  { "label": "Pending → Active ↔ Frozen; Active → {Closed, Liquidated}", "description": "Includes admin-pausable Frozen state." },
  { "label": "Free-form / handler-driven", "description": "No fixed transition graph." }
] }
```

**User clicks:** "Pending → {Active, Closed}; Active → {Closed,
Liquidated}." (Confirms abandoning a `Pending` via `close_position`
is intended; `liquidate` from `Pending` is **not** — confirming the
Phase-1 MED.)

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A locks the transition graph as the
ratified state-machine spec; any handler whose effect produces a
non-edge transition becomes HIGH-or-CRIT. The Phase-1 MED auto-
promotes (intent gap now confirmed) and the report-line text shifts
from "*candidate* skip-transition" to "**confirmed** skip-transition:
`liquidate` accepts `Pending`."

### Batch 3 — Authority graph

```json
{ "question": "Which authority roles exist?", "header": "Authorities", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
  { "label": "position_owner — opens / borrows / repays / closes own position", "description": "Per-position signer.",
    "preview": "#[account(mut, has_one = owner)] pub position: Account<'info, Position>, pub owner: Signer<'info>," },
  { "label": "liquidator — any signer can liquidate under-collateralized position", "description": "Permissionless liquidation.",
    "preview": "fn liquidate(ctx: Context<Liquidate>, position_key: Pubkey) -> Result<()> { /* no admin signer; any signer accepted */ }" },
  { "label": "oracle — price feed authority", "description": "Signs price updates consumed by solvency check.",
    "preview": "#[account(constraint = oracle.authority == ORACLE_PUBKEY)] pub oracle: Account<'info, PriceOracle>," },
  { "label": "pool_admin — adjusts collateral_factor / liq_bonus", "description": "Privileged parameter updates.",
    "preview": "fn set_params(ctx: Context<SetParams>, ...) -> Result<()> { /* admin: Signer */ }" }
] }
```

**User clicks:** all four.

**Phase 3 effect:** permissionless-`liquidate` probe is upgraded:
every input that should be rejected (Pending, solvent, already-
Liquidated) becomes a fired-or-silent harness. Producer B queues a
separate oracle-drift sweep and a `compromised oracle` what-if for
Phase 4.

### Batch 4 — Threat scenarios + intentional gaps

```json
[
  { "question": "Which attacker model?", "header": "Threat", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
    { "label": "Unprivileged attacker, no signers", "description": "Anonymous caller against permissionless handlers." },
    { "label": "Compromised user signer", "description": "Attacker holds arbitrary position-owner key." },
    { "label": "Compromised authority (admin / oracle)", "description": "Attacker controls parameter-update or price-feed keys." },
    { "label": "No specific threat model" }
  ] },
  { "question": "Acknowledged shortcuts?", "header": "Shortcuts", "multiSelect": true, "options": [
    { "label": "Oracle staleness window up to 60 slots", "description": "Stale-but-bounded prices accepted by design." },
    { "label": "Admin can drain pool by setting collateral_factor = u64::MAX", "description": "Privileged role trusted." },
    { "label": "Liquidation bonus paid even on zero-debt positions", "description": "Known dust-edge case." },
    { "label": "Interest accrual is per-handler, not per-slot", "description": "Stale interest between calls accepted." }
  ] }
]
```

**User clicks:** attacker = "Unprivileged attacker, no signers";
shortcuts = "Oracle staleness window up to 60 slots" + "Interest
accrual is per-handler, not per-slot."

**Phase 3 effect:** Producer A spends remaining budget on the
permissionless-liquidate surface — the Phase-1 MED was in this class
and the threat-model answer says "find more like that." The stale-
oracle shortcut means the auditor doesn't flag the 60-slot window per
se, but a finding showing the window is **unbounded in practice**
(e.g. no slot-diff check at all) still surfaces — the shortcut
suppresses the intent gap, not the implementation gap.

## Fallback for harnesses without `AskUserQuestion`-equivalent

Harnesses without a native structured-question primitive (Codex /
Cursor / etc.) fall back to the v2.19 file-driven path:

1. Agent runs the producer that emits cluster cards (the existing
   `qedgen probe --emit-spec-candidates` flow).
2. CLI writes `.qed/interview/interview.md` with one section per
   cluster + a free-text invariants section at the top.
3. Agent surfaces the file: "Open `.qed/interview/interview.md`, fill
   the invariants section, check the cluster cards, save."
4. Agent re-reads on completion (chat signal) and proceeds to Phase 3
   with the parsed ratifications.

The file path produces strictly less interview signal than the TUI
path (free-form invariants, no per-option `preview`, no enriched
state-machine options). It's the **graceful degrade**, not the target
UX — ship Claude-Code TUI primary, file fallback secondary.
