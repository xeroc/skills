# Probe orchestration — operating Producer A

Operational runbook for Producer A (the probe-driven discovery loop).
Read this when you're about to fan out repro emissions, choose
foreground vs background execution, or wire up the
probe→skeleton→Crucible auto-chain.

The companion document `workflow_walkthrough.md` shows the *shape* of
an end-to-end audit. This file is the engine room: which probe tier
runs when, in what mode, with what budget, and what to do when it
hangs.

---

## Time-to-fire ordering

The audit's operational metric is **time-to-first-reproducible MED+**.
Fast-fire first, slow-fire queued behind. Three tiers.

### Tier 1 — Mollusk (≈30s compile per repro, parallel)

In-process SVM driver. Each repro is a Rust integration test that
loads the program, builds an attack instruction, asserts the bug is
observable. Agent writes test files directly to
`target/qedgen-repros/audit/<finding-id>.rs` (no `--fill` verb — per
`feedback_repros_agent_authored`), then `cargo test` fans them.

~30s per test cold, but cargo parallelizes within one invocation. 14
repros warm-cache compile in ~45-60s; first fires land ~T+0:08 from
cold start including the parallel-write block.

In repro semantics, `test … ok` *is* fired (the attack assertion
held). `FAILED` is silent.

```
test qedgen_repros_F15 ... ok      <-- fired (bug observable)
test qedgen_repros_F4  ... FAILED  <-- silent (couldn't reproduce)
```

**Default tier — always run.**

### Tier 2 — Miri (3-5 min per repro, single-threaded)

Rust's MIR interpreter. Catches UB / aliasing / overflow that
survived Mollusk's coarse-grained execution (transmute soundness,
raw-pointer escape, write-through-`&` UB). Dual-execution divergence
(Miri-fail / Mollusk-pass) is itself a `Category::ExecutionDivergence`
critical finding.

```
Bash (run_in_background=true): cargo +nightly miri test \
    --release --test 'qedgen_repros_*' -- --test-threads=1 \
    2>&1 | tee .qed/audit/<ts>/miri.log
```

3-5 min per repro, single-threaded (miri isn't internally parallel).
Run on the *unsafe-touching* subset only — Pinocchio sites tagged
`BorrowUnchecked`, `BytemuckCall`, `RawPtrCastFromAccount`,
`SetLamportsArith` with raw-pointer math.

Fired output: `Undefined Behavior`, `Stacked Borrow violation`, `would
overflow`, plus the `SAFETY claim STALE` marker when a `// SAFETY:`
comment contradicts Miri's analysis. `miri_verify` parses these into
`MiriDiagnostic`s.

**Default tier — unsafe-touching subset only.**

### Tier 3 — Crucible (`--fuzz`, minutes to hours, background)

Coverage-guided fuzzing against the harness from the spec (or
auto-ratified skeleton, per the auto-chain below). Each crash →
`Reproducer::Crucible` finding.

```
Bash (run_in_background=true): qedgen probe \
    --fuzz 300 --spec .qed/audit/<ts>/skeleton.qedspec --no-smoke \
    --json > .qed/audit/<ts>/crucible.json
```

Budget tuning: 300s first pass; 1800s (30 min) if depth is wanted;
3600s+ overnight if the user explicitly asks.

Fired output: `findings[]` in JSON. Each has `Reproducer::Crucible`
with input bytes + reproducing call sequence.

**Default tier — gated on the auto-chain (brownfield needs a skeleton
spec first).**

---

## Parallel emission pattern

When the probe enumerates N sites, emit N repro prompts in a **single
message** so they fan in parallel. Then run them through one `cargo
test` invocation that cargo concurrency-fans internally.

### Repro emission (parallel Writes, one block)

```
Write: target/qedgen-repros/audit/F1.rs
Write: target/qedgen-repros/audit/F2.rs
Write: target/qedgen-repros/audit/F3.rs
… (one Write per site, all in the same <function_calls> block)
```

For 14 sites the agent's message contains 14 parallel `Write` calls.
Each is a complete Mollusk test (SKILL.md step 5 template). The
`Bash` invocation comes *after* the Writes return.

### Cargo fan (one invocation, all repros)

```
Bash (run_in_background=true): cargo test --release \
    --test 'qedgen_repros_*' \
    -- --test-threads=$(nproc) \
    2>&1 | tee .qed/audit/<ts>/mollusk.log
```

Cargo's internal concurrency saturates the box. Don't fan multiple
`cargo test` calls — they fight for the build lock and serialize
compilation.

**Anti-patterns:** one repro per message (kills the fan, ×N wait); one
`cargo test` per file (serializes compile, cache-busts); awaiting the
fan in foreground (B should be reading code while it compiles).

---

## Background choreography

Long-running phases run under Bash `run_in_background=true`. Producer
B continues foreground; notifications fire on completion.

**Background:** `cargo test` expected to take >10s (cold Mollusk
fans, Miri); `qedgen probe --fuzz` (always); `cargo +nightly miri
test` (always).

**Foreground:** `qedgen probe` without `--fuzz` (~6s pattern-match);
`qedgen probe --emit-spec-candidates` (fast); all `Read` / `Write` /
sub-5s `Bash` (grep, single-file `cargo check`).

### Hang handling

If a background job hasn't notified within 2× its expected budget:

1. **Don't kill blindly.** Foreground inspect:
   `ps -o pid,etime,cmd -p $(pgrep -f "qedgen_repros_")` or
   `tail -30 .qed/audit/<ts>/mollusk.log`.
2. **Cargo lock contention** — another `cargo` holds the build lock.
   Cargo block-waits; correct behavior, not a hang.
3. **Miri OOM** — heap grows on tight loops. Kill the PID, shorten
   the repro's loop bound, re-run.
4. **Crucible budget overrun** — by definition. `--fuzz 300` takes
   300s + setup + shutdown (~315-330s). Wait full budget + 30s.
5. **Genuinely stuck:** kill the PID, surface inconclusive for that
   tier, continue. Don't block the audit on one tier.

## Probe → skeleton → Crucible auto-chain

The v2.20 deliverable that closes the brownfield-to-Crucible gap.
Without this chain, `qedgen probe --fuzz` errors with `--fuzz requires
--spec` on brownfield projects, so the audit never reaches
coverage-guided fuzzing.

### Step 1 — emit spec candidates

```
Bash: qedgen probe --program <root> \
        --emit-spec-candidates \
        --audit-dir .qed/audit/<ts>/
```

Writes three files to the audit dir:
- `interview.md` — markdown checkboxes, one section per cluster.
- `clusters.json` — full schema-v3 envelope.
- `skeleton.qedspec` — pre-interview structural skeleton (handler
  stubs, no `requires` / `effect` bodies yet).

### Step 2 — auto-ratify *high-confidence* clusters

Agent edits `skeleton.qedspec` in place, merging only high-confidence
clusters into handler bodies / top-level invariants. **Do not prompt
the user here** — Phase 2 hasn't fired yet.

**High-confidence = the cluster has an explicit code anchor.**
Specifically:

- `account_signer_check` — cluster names a specific account binding
  AND handler reads `<binding>.is_signer` (or `assert!(…is_signer)`)
  in source. Signer name is *literal* in code, not inferred.
- `account_owner_check` — cluster names a specific account AND handler
  reads `<binding>.owner == <PROGRAM_ID>` (or Pinocchio equivalent).
  Owner check is literal.
- `arithmetic_no_overflow` on `checked_*` / `saturating_*` — call name
  is literal and the cluster matches it exactly.
- `lifecycle_one_shot` — source contains a literal `is_initialized`
  field read + write, and the cluster's claim is monotonicity.

**Deferred to Phase 2** (low-confidence):

- Conservation invariants — require a *sum* across accounts; informed
  but not literally anchored.
- Authority-graph clauses beyond signer/owner — admin rotation,
  multi-role handoff.
- Threat model — entirely user-intent.
- Anything probe-classified `confidence: low` or `confidence: medium`.

**The check:** if you can point at a specific line of source code and
say "this line is the cluster's anchor," it's high-confidence. If
you're inferring from context, it's not.

### Step 3 — fire Crucible against the auto-ratified skeleton

```
Bash (run_in_background=true): qedgen probe \
        --fuzz 300 \
        --spec .qed/audit/<ts>/skeleton.qedspec \
        --json > .qed/audit/<ts>/crucible.json
```

Crucible reads the high-confidence invariants and fuzzes for
counterexamples. Each crash streams into Producer A's surface as a
fired finding — same event-driven rule as Mollusk:

> Found `<category>` [SEV]: <one-line>. Repro at <crucible.json#fN>.
> Continuing.

### Step 4 — risk and mitigation

**The risk:** auto-ratification encodes wrong invariants → Crucible
fires on wrong properties. User sees a "fired" finding that actually
tests an invariant they never agreed to.

**The mitigation:** the literal-anchor bar in step 2. Every
auto-ratified clause has a source-code anchor the agent can cite on
the surface line:

> Found `account_signer_check` [CRITICAL]: `update_fee_rate` accepts
> non-admin signers. **Auto-ratified invariant** (anchored at
> `update_fee_rate.rs:9` — `assert!(admin.is_signer)`). Repro at
> `crucible.json#f3`. Continuing.

If the citation looks wrong on the surface line, the user
correctness-checks the ratification immediately. The literal-anchor
requirement is what keeps the false-positive rate low.

**When in doubt, defer.** A cluster that doesn't meet the bar goes to
Phase 2's interview, where the user ratifies it directly. Phase 3
re-runs Crucible with the user-ratified skeleton.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't serialize the producers.** A and B run concurrently. B's
  reads don't wait for A's probe to complete.
- **Don't wait for all probes to complete before reading.** B's
  intent extraction starts as soon as the files load.
- **Don't batch findings into a final report during Phase 1.** Surface
  each fired MED+ the instant it fires.
- **Don't run `cargo test` per repro.** One invocation, parallel fan.
- **Don't run Crucible synchronously.** Always
  `run_in_background=true`.
- **Don't prompt the user during Phase 1.** No `AskUserQuestion`. The
  first fired MED+ is the implicit "keep going."
- **Don't auto-ratify low-confidence clusters.** Literal anchor only;
  defer to Phase 2 when in doubt.
- **Don't read this file end-to-end during an audit.** Read the
  tier-or-step section you're about to invoke.
