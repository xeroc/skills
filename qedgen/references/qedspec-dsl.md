# qedspec DSL Reference

The `.qedspec` file is the single source of truth for a program's formal
specification. QEDGen parses it (chumsky parser), validates it (`qedgen
check`), and generates all downstream artifacts: Anchor-compatible Rust
handlers, Lean proofs, Kani harnesses, proptest suites, CI workflows, and the
`#[qed(verified, spec, handler, spec_hash)]` drift attributes that tie
generated code back to the spec.

This reference covers the current (v2.25) grammar. Where the parser emits a
specific AST node shape that influences codegen (match, constructors, record
updates, `mul_div_*`), the node name is called out so you can follow the
transform into the Lean/Rust backends.

## What changed in v2.25

- **`ref_impl name (...) : T = <expr>` top-level declarations.** Reference
  implementations that `ensures` clauses can call by name. Lower to Lean
  `def`s (proofs `unfold` them) and to Rust `fn`s embedded in the Kani
  harness so ensures-preservation assertions can invoke them. Handler
  codegen skips ref_impls — they're verification-only, not part of the
  impl contract. See [`ref_impl`](#ref_impl-v225).
- **`modifies [X, Y]` agent-fill sites.** When `modifies` declares a
  field the `effect` block doesn't write, codegen emits a structured
  `todo!()` site in the Rust handler with the relevant `ensures`
  clauses quoted as comments. The agent (or you) fills the math
  against the quoted contract.
- **`unconstrained_modifies` P0 lint.** Fires when a field appears in
  `modifies [...]` but neither the effect block writes it nor any
  `ensures` references it. That shape is completely unverified — add
  an `ensures` constraint or drop the field from `modifies`.
- **Ensures-preservation Kani harnesses.** For every handler with
  `ensures <expr>` clauses, codegen emits a Kani BMC harness that
  snapshots `pre = s.clone()`, runs the spec-translated transition,
  and asserts each ensures clause against `(pre, post)`. Counterexamples
  surface contract gaps the spec model couldn't satisfy on its own.

## What changed in v2.7

- **`+=` / `-=` default to checked semantics in Anchor handler bodies too**
  (v2.6 already did this for the Kani model). `pool += net` lowers to
  `self.pool = self.pool.checked_add(net).ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?`
  — the pattern deployed programs use. Pre-v2.7 this lowered to
  `wrapping_add` which didn't match production.
- **Explicit per-effect arithmetic modifiers.** `+=! ` (saturating) and `+=?`
  (wrapping) opt out of the checked default when the handler *deliberately*
  wants those semantics. Same three tiers for `-=!` / `-=?`. See
  [Effect arithmetic](#effect-arithmetic) below.
- **`permissionless` handler marker.** New body clause that opts the handler
  out of the `no_access_control` P1 lint — for deliberately-unauthenticated
  handlers like `deposit_collateral`, `init_user`, donations. Declaring both
  `auth X` and `permissionless` on one handler fires a `contradictory_auth`
  P1. See [Handler clauses](#handler-clauses).
- **proptest `Arbitrary` strategies for records + unit-variant sums.** Each
  record type emits a `prop_compose! { fn arb_<Name>(…) -> <Name> { … } }`
  block; each unit-variant sum emits a `prop_oneof!` strategy. `arb_state`
  now correctly composes these instead of bailing to `0u64..=u64::MAX` for
  user-typed fields.
- **`Map[N] T` strategies use strict-length Vec + `TryInto`.** Works for any
  N; proptest's `prop::array::uniform*` combinators cap at 32 which wasn't
  enough for `Map[1024] Account`.
- **`--spec <dir>` accepts directories** across every CLI subcommand
  (`check`, `codegen`, `verify`, `spec`, `reconcile`). Multi-file specs
  already worked at the parser level; v2.7 locks it in as CLI-level
  contract with clearer errors on missing paths.

## What changed in v2.6

- **`+=` / `-=` default to checked arithmetic** in the generated Kani model.
  On overflow the transition returns `false` — mirroring the
  `checked_add(..).ok_or(MathOverflow)?` pattern deployed Anchor programs
  use. Proptest mode keeps wrapping arithmetic for bounded exploration.
  Before v2.6 the Kani model emitted bare `+=`, which flagged overflow on
  every unbounded pre-state (a spec-model artifact that didn't match real
  programs).
- **`state { fields }` sugar parses** as documented. Accepts
  comma- or newline-separated fields; desugars to `type State = { ... }`.
- **Single-line `accounts { a : signer, b : writable, ... }` parses.**
  Attribute commas and descriptor commas disambiguate via lookahead for
  `<ident> :`, so multi-line and compact forms both work.
- **`implies` lowers to valid Rust** (`(!a) || (b)`) in generated Kani and
  proptest property bodies. `forall` / `exists` in property bodies emit a
  `/* QEDGEN_UNSUPPORTED_QUANTIFIER */` marker — the property fn returns
  `true` (non-blocking) and the body should be lifted to harness-level
  `kani::any()` scaffolding instead.
- **Multi-variant ADTs with shared field names deduplicate** when flattened
  into the state model. First-variant wins on collisions. Proper
  enum+match codegen remains on the roadmap.
- **Default output layout changed.** `qedgen codegen --kani` / `--proptest`
  write to `./programs/tests/kani.rs` / `./programs/tests/proptest.rs` so
  `cargo kani --tests` and `cargo test --test proptest` resolve the
  program's `Cargo.toml` directly. `qedgen verify` matches. Pass
  `--kani-output` / `--proptest-output` to override.
- **`qedgen init` refuses to nest `formal_verification/formal_verification/`.**
  If run from inside an existing `formal_verification/` it bails with a
  fix hint (`--output-dir .`).
- **Generated `Cargo.toml` points at real deps.** `anchor-lang` +
  `anchor-spl` are the target framework; `qedgen-macros` is a git-dep
  at the release tag. Dependency lines start commented with a clear TODO
  so `cargo build` surfaces the contract instead of pretending the
  scaffold is complete.
- **Vacuous `verify_*_rejects_invalid` Kani harnesses are gone.** The
  `kani::assume(!(true))` footgun is fixed — harnesses now negate the
  full `guard + requires` conjunction, or skip entirely when the handler
  has no preconditions.
- **`verify_*_effects` is split per-field.** One `verify_X_effect_{field}`
  harness per effect, with `kani::solver(minisat)` when the RHS contains
  `*` or `/`. No more 20-minute cadical wedges on chained fee arithmetic.

## What changed in v2.5

- **`pragma <name> { ... }`** — platform-specific namespace. sBPF-specific
  constructs (`instruction`, `pubkey`, top-level `errors [...]`) now live
  only inside `pragma sbpf { ... }`. See *Pragmas* below.
- **`target` keyword removed.** Target is inferred from pragma presence —
  `pragma sbpf` → assembly target, absent → framework-flavored Rust.
  Framework selection happens at codegen time via `qedgen init
  --target {anchor,quasar,pinocchio}` — all three emit a full program
  scaffold.
- **`assembly "..."` keyword removed.** Assembly source path is tooling
  config, not spec intent — pass `qedgen asm2lean --input <path>` or use
  the convention of `src/program.s` next to the spec.
- **`interface Name { ... }` + `call Target.handler(...)`** — declarative
  CPI contracts. See *Interface declarations*.
- **Multi-file specs.** `parse_spec_file` accepts a directory of `.qedspec`
  fragments (all declaring the same `spec Name`); fragments are merged
  deterministically in sorted-path order.
- **`let x = v in body` in expressions** — ML-style binding inside
  `ensures` / `requires` / effect RHS.

## File structure

```fsharp
spec ProgramName

// Top-level declarations (any order)
program_id "1111...1111"

const MAX_MEMBERS = 32

type State
  | Uninitialized
  | Active of { authority : Pubkey, balance : U64 }
  | Closed

interface Token { ... }     // callee contracts for CPI
pragma sbpf { ... }         // platform-specific namespace (opt-in; selects sBPF target)

handler initialize ...
property conservation ...
invariant backing ...
cover happy_path [...]
liveness settles ...
environment oracle { ... }
```

Comments: `//` line comments, `///` doc comments (attached to the next item).

## Project pinning — `.qed/config.json`

`qedgen init --name <name> --spec <path>` records the authored spec's
location in `.qed/config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "escrow",
  "spec": "escrow.qedspec",           // path, relative to the project root
  "interfaces_dir": ".qed/interfaces" // vendored library interfaces
}
```

`qedgen check` / `qedgen codegen` with no `--spec` argument walk upward from
the current directory, find the nearest `.qed/config.json`, and resolve the
spec via the `spec` field. Explicit `--spec <path>` still overrides the
config — useful for scripts or one-off checks against a different spec.

Authored `.qedspec` files stay at the program root (visible, committed,
user-edited). Tool-managed library interfaces live under
`.qed/interfaces/` and are dropped there by `qedgen interface --idl
<path> --vendor`.

## Multi-file specs

`qedgen check --spec <path>` accepts either a single `.qedspec` file or a
directory of fragments. In directory mode, every `*.qedspec` under the path
(recursively) is parsed, and all fragments must declare the same `spec
Name`. Top items are merged in alphabetically-sorted source-path order —
both the merged `ParsedSpec` and every downstream artifact are
deterministic.

Convention-based layout (no new grammar required):

```fsharp
my-program/
  escrow.qedspec            # spec header + types + events + errors
  handlers/
    initialize.qedspec      # spec Escrow + handler initialize { ... }
    exchange.qedspec        # spec Escrow + handler exchange { ... }
    cancel.qedspec          # spec Escrow + handler cancel { ... }
  properties.qedspec        # spec Escrow + invariants + covers + liveness
  interfaces/               # scoped copies of library interfaces
    token.qedspec           # spec Escrow + interface Token { ... }
```

See `examples/rust/escrow-split/` for a concrete demo.

## Top-level declarations

### `spec`

Required header. Names the program.

```fsharp
spec Escrow
```

### `program_id`

On-chain program address.

```fsharp
program_id "11111111111111111111111111111111"
```

### `const`

Named integer constants. Underscores allowed for readability. Negative
literals are accepted (v2.29) — useful for fixed-point exponents and
other signed integer values.

```fsharp
const MAX_MEMBERS = 32
const MAX_VAULT_TVL = 10_000_000_000_000_000
const FP_EXPONENT = -6              // v2.29: signed literal in const_decl
```

Expressions in `const` bodies (arithmetic, paren, references to other
declared consts) are not yet supported — `const N6 = 0 - 6` is rejected
by the parser. Use the negative-literal form `const N6 = -6` instead.
Full const-expression evaluation is v2.30+.

## Type system

### Records

```fsharp
// Flat record — no sum tag
type Account = {
  active        : U8,
  capital       : U128,
  reserved_pnl  : U128,
  pnl           : I128,
  fee_credits   : U128,
}
```

### Sum types (ADTs)

ML-style sum types with optional payloads. Variants without payload are bare
idents; payload variants use `of { ... }`.

```fsharp
// State ADT — variants with optional payloads
type State
  | Uninitialized
  | Active of {
      authority : Pubkey,
      V         : U128,
      I         : U128,
      F         : U128,
      accounts  : Map[MAX_ACCOUNTS] Account,
    }
  | Draining
  | Resetting
```

Sum types used as `Map` values are emitted as proper Lean `inductive`
declarations; state ADTs flatten for downstream transition codegen.

### Error types

`type Error | ...` is a flat enum with optional numeric code + description.

```fsharp
type Error
  | InvalidAmount
  | Unauthorized
  | InvalidDiscriminant = 1 "Discriminant is not REGISTER_MARKET"
  | InvalidLength       = 2 "Instruction data wrong length"
```

The legacy `errors [...]` sugar (below) still works and desugars to this.

### Type aliases

```fsharp
type AccountIdx = Fin[MAX_ACCOUNTS]
type Amount     = U128
```

`Fin[N]` is a bounded natural index domain of size `N` — the canonical shape
for subscripting a `Map[N] T` field.

### Parameterised and map types

Type expressions: `Pubkey`, `U8`, `U16`, `U64`, `U128`, `I128`, `Vec U64`,
`Option Pubkey`, `Map[N] T`, `Fin[N]`.

```fsharp
accounts : Map[MAX_ACCOUNTS] Account
slots    : Map[16] (Option Pubkey)
```

**Pubkey lowering (v2.21):** the user-facing Anchor / Quasar program
target keeps `Pubkey` (Solana's 32-byte newtype) so on-chain accounts
work normally. In the generated proptest / Kani harnesses, `Pubkey`
state fields lower to `[u8; 32]` automatically — the structurally-
equivalent byte array that proptest's `prop::array::uniform32(0u8..)`
strategy already generates. P6 fires at `Info` severity as a note,
not as a `Warning`; no spec-side action is required.

### `state` (sugar)

Shorthand for a single unnamed account record. Equivalent to a one-variant
record type.

```fsharp
state {
  balance : U64
  owner   : Pubkey
}
```

### `ref_impl` (v2.25)

Reference implementation. Names a pure expression that `ensures` clauses
can call by name. Lowers to a Lean `def` (proofs can `unfold` it) and to
a Rust `fn` embedded in the Kani harness so ensures-preservation
assertions can invoke it. Rust handler codegen *skips* `ref_impl`
entirely — it's a verification fixture, not part of the impl contract.
The user's real impl can compute the same value via the literal
expression or via a semantically-equivalent variant (ceiling vs floor
division, checked arithmetic, etc.); Kani verifies they agree.

```fsharp
ref_impl lp_out (s_lp_supply : U64) (s_pool_balance : U64) (amount : U64) : U64 =
  if s_lp_supply == 0
    then amount
    else (amount * s_lp_supply) / s_pool_balance

handler deposit (amount_stablecoin : U64) {
  modifies [pool_balance, lp_supply]
  effect { pool_balance += amount_stablecoin }
  ensures state.lp_supply == old(state.lp_supply)
                            + lp_out(old(state.lp_supply),
                                     old(state.pool_balance),
                                     amount_stablecoin)
}
```

Rules:

  - Parameters are `(name : Type)` in parentheses; multiple parameters
    each in their own parens (no comma-separated tuple form).
  - Body is a pure expression — no state mutation, no `match` with
    side-effect arms. v2.26 Slice 3 added composition: ref_impls can
    call other ref_impls (recursive calls are rejected at parse time
    with a clear error), take `Map[N] T` parameters (lowered to
    `[T; N]` in Rust and `Map N T = Fin N → T` in Lean), and are
    callable from `requires` bodies via the generated
    `programs/src/ref_impls.rs` module.
  - **v2.26 lint `ref_impl_unbounded_arith` (P2)** fires when a
    ref_impl body has `*`, `<<`, `+`, or `-` over bounded-numeric
    (`U64`/`I64`/...) params or return. Lean lowers those to
    `Nat`/`Int` (unbounded — no overflow); Rust runs on bounded
    `u64`/`i64` where the same expression can wrap or panic. Same
    predicate auto-triggers the impl-targeted Kani harness so
    bounded-arith verification runs even without the explicit
    `--kani-impl` flag.
  - Naming a ref_impl shadows any same-named uninterpreted helper:
    code that calls `lp_out(...)` in an `ensures` body resolves to
    the real definition, not the axiomatic `opaque foo : T → Bool`
    fallback.

When *not* to use `ref_impl`: simple inline expressions belong directly
in `ensures`. Reach for `ref_impl` when the same math appears in
multiple `ensures` clauses or when the math is too complex to inline
readably (LP share-value, mul-div with rounding, Pyth-style price
derivations).

### `ghost`

Spec-only **auxiliary state** — a field that exists purely for
verification (invariants, properties, `requires`/`ensures`) and never
appears in the on-chain program. Use it for a quantity the program
doesn't store but you want to reason about: a running total, a count of
operations, a high-water mark.

```
ghost total_supply : U64 {
  init { 0 }
  on mint { total_supply := state.total_supply + amount }
  on burn { total_supply := state.total_supply - amount }
}

property supply_tracks_balance :
  state.total_supply == state.balance
  preserved_by all
```

- **`init { <expr> }`** — the ghost's value when the State is first
  constructed. A constant expression.
- **`on <handler> { <name> := <expr> }`** — how the ghost changes when
  that handler runs. The named handler's parameters are in scope (no
  type redeclaration), and the RHS may read the ghost's own pre-value as
  `state.<name>`. A handler with no `on` clause leaves the ghost
  unchanged (frame condition). `+=` / `-=` work as in a real effect.
- Reference the ghost anywhere as `state.<name>` — in properties,
  invariants, `requires`, `ensures`.

**Codegen.** The ghost becomes a field on the *verification* State
(Lean `structure State`, proptest / Kani `struct State`), updated
alongside the real effects in each handler's transition. It is **omitted
from the on-chain program codegen** (Anchor / Quasar / Pinocchio) — it
has no storage cost and no runtime presence.

**Validation note.** A ghost is a function of the handler history, so
its invariants are checked inductively from `init`: the proptest
`state_machine_sequence` harness drives random handler sequences from the
initial state and asserts the property after each step. The single-step
`<handler>_preserves_<prop>` harness is *skipped* for ghost-referencing
properties (an arbitrary pre-state ghost value rarely satisfies the
invariant, so rejection sampling would exhaust). The Lean preservation
proof is written in `Proofs.lean` like any other.

**Scope.** v1 wires ghosts into the **flat single-account** State shape
(the canonical token example). Indexed (`Map[N]`), multi-account, and
explicit-ADT state shapes fire the `ghost_unsupported_state_shape` lint —
track the aggregate in a `property` (`sum i : Idx, accounts[i].x`)
instead, which is fully supported there. Ghosts must be **scalar**
(`U8…U128` / `I8…I128` / `Bool`); a non-scalar fires
`ghost_non_scalar_type`, and an `on` clause naming a missing handler
fires `ghost_update_unknown_handler`.

`ghost` vs [`ref_impl`](#ref_impl-v225): a `ref_impl` is a *stateless*
pure function the real Rust impl is checked against; a `ghost` is
*stateful* spec-only state with no on-chain counterpart.

### `hook`

A cross-cutting **assertion fired at a statement boundary** inside any
handler — for checking a condition at an *intermediate* point, not just at
handler exit (which is what `property` covers).

```
hook after_store(balance) {
  assert state.balance <= state.cap
}
```

- **`after_store(<field>)`** — fires immediately after any store to
  `<field>`, in every handler that writes it. The assertion sees the
  post-store state. The RHS may read state and handler params.
- One or more `assert <expr>` per hook (optional trailing `;`).

**Enforcement.** Hooks are checked in the **runtime backends** (Kani +
proptest): the assertion is injected into the spec-model transition right
after the field's effect, so a violation surfaces as a verification
failure / failing test. The `state_machine_sequence` proptest harness is
emitted whenever a spec declares hooks, so the assertions are actually
exercised across random handler sequences. Hooks are **omitted from the
on-chain program codegen** entirely.

**Lean.** Lean enforcement is deferred (it lands with qedsvm); a spec with
hooks fires the informational `hook_lean_unsupported` lint. Use
`qedgen verify --kani` / `--proptest` to exercise them today.

**`before_cpi`.** `hook before_cpi { … }` / `hook before_cpi(<Iface>) { … }`
parses, but enforcement is deferred (`hook_before_cpi_unsupported` lint):
the runtime state model has no CPI to anchor to, and the natural home —
the Lean CPI-theorem precondition — is on the deferred Lean path. Encode
the precondition as a `requires` on the calling handler for now.

**Scope / lints.** `after_store` is wired into the **flat single-account**
transition; indexed/multi-account shapes fire
`hook_unsupported_state_shape`. `after_store(<field>)` naming a non-state
field fires `hook_unknown_field`; an empty hook body fires `hook_no_assert`.

## PDA and events

### `pda`

PDA seed derivation. Seeds can be string literals or identifiers.

```fsharp
pda escrow ["escrow", initializer]
pda market ["base_mint", "quote_mint"]
pda loan ["loan", pool, borrower]
```

### `event`

Event type with typed fields.

```fsharp
event PoolInitialized { authority : Pubkey, rate : U64 }
event Deposited       { depositor : Pubkey, amount : U64 }
```

## Error declarations

At the top level, declare errors with `type Error | Variant | ...`:

```fsharp
type Error
  | Unauthorized
  | InvalidAmount
  | AlreadyClosed
```

Valued form (with codes + descriptions) uses the same ADT syntax:

```fsharp
type Error
  | InvalidAccountCount  = 1 "Invalid number of accounts"
  | InsufficientLamports = 7 "Sender has insufficient lamports"
```

The `errors [ ... ]` list-sugar is v2.5-restricted to inside `pragma sbpf
{ ... }` — see the sBPF section.

## Handlers

Handlers are the core building block — each one models a program instruction.
They use an ML-style signature with optional parameters and state transition.

### Syntax

```fsharp
/// Doc comment (optional, captured)
handler name (param1 : Type) (param2 : Type) : PreState -> PostState {
  // clauses
}
```

All parts of the signature are optional:

```fsharp
// Full signature
handler initialize (amount : U64) : State.Uninitialized -> State.Active { ... }

// No params
handler cancel : State.Open -> State.Closed { ... }

// No transition (pure guard program)
handler check_slippage { ... }

// No params, no transition
handler transfer_sol { ... }
```

### Handler clauses

> **Cross-program authority** — when the signing identity isn't stored in this
> program's state (e.g. the admin lives on a PDA owned by another program),
> three lowering paths work:
>
> 1. **`auth <acct>.<field>` (v2.29.1+, preferred for cross-program auth).**
>    Dotted form reads the auth identity directly off a handler-bound
>    account — including an imported program's account (`auth
>    admin_config.admin`). The adapter desugars to
>    `requires <acct>.<field> == <signer>.pubkey else Unauthorized`
>    against the handler's lone signer. Skipped when the handler has 0 or
>    2+ signers (use option 3 then).
>
> 2. **Persist on init via [`<account>.pubkey`](#accountpubkey-accessor).**
>    Capture the signer into local state (`effect { admin := admin.pubkey }`)
>    on the init handler, then gate later handlers with `requires state.admin
>    == admin.pubkey`. Adds a persistent state field.
>
> 3. **Inline `requires` field comparison.** The general form. Works for any
>    field-read shape including multi-signer handlers:
>    `requires foreign_config.admin == chosen_signer.pubkey else Unauthorized`.
>
> Bare `auth <name>` (no dot) still does the original state-field lookup —
> lowers to Anchor `has_one = <name>` for flat state, or to the variant-
> destructure auth guard for multi-variant ADT.

| Clause | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | Access control (signer must match field). Dotted form (v2.29.1+) reads from an imported account: `auth admin_config.admin`. | `auth authority`, `auth admin_config.admin` |
| `accounts { ... }` | Account descriptors | see below |
| `requires expr else Error` | Guard with error code | `requires amount > 0 else InvalidAmount` |
| `requires expr` | Guard without error code | `requires state.member_count > state.threshold` |
| `ensures expr` | Postcondition | `ensures state.balance >= 0` |
| `modifies [fields]` | Modification set | `modifies [balance, counter]` |
| `let name = expr` | Local binding | `let fee = amount * 3 / 100` |
| `effect { ... }` | State mutations | see below |
| `transfers { ... }` | Token transfer declarations | see below |
| `emits Event` | Event emission | `emits PoolInitialized` |
| `match { ... }` | Guarded branching | see below |
| `aborts_total` | Handler must reject on all guard failures | `aborts_total` |
| `invariant name` | Preserve a global invariant (assume pre, assert post) | `invariant conservation` |
| `establishes name` | Establish a global invariant at post-state without assuming it pre-state. Use for init / one-shot handlers. | `establishes root_set` |
| `permissionless` | Opt out of the `no_access_control` lint (v2.7) | see below |
| `takes { ... }` | Parameters (sugar, prefer signature) | `takes amount : U64` |
| `abstract` (v2.29) | Existentially-quantified value the handler refers to in `requires` / `effect` / `ensures` without expressing how it was computed. | `abstract d : U64` |

#### `abstract <name> : <Type>` (v2.29)

When a handler's spec depends on a value that comes from a library call or
external math the DSL can't model directly (e.g. a price oracle, a curve
solver, a precomputed Merkle proof element), declare it as `abstract`. The
binder is in scope inside `requires` / `effect` / `ensures` clauses and the
`requires` set constrains the symbolic value at verification time.

```fsharp
handler user_deposit (amount_stablecoin : U64) : State.Active -> State.Active {
  abstract d : U64                  // shares of LP token to mint
  requires d > 0
  requires d <= amount_stablecoin

  effect { lp_supply += d }
  ensures state.lp_supply == old(state.lp_supply) + d
}
```

Per-backend lowering:
- **Kani** — `let d: u64 = kani::any();` followed by the `requires`-derived
  `kani::assume(...)` so the verifier explores values that satisfy the
  constraint set.
- **proptest** — `d in <boundary strategy>` is added to the proptest test
  parameter list; the same `requires`-derived `prop_assume!` filters.
- **Rust scaffold** — `let d: T = todo!("v2.29 abstract binder ...")`. The
  agent fills the body with the concrete library / math call that
  produces `d`; the `requires` constraints are surfaced in the
  todo!() prompt so the implementation knows the contract.
- **Lean** — Lean lowering is v2.29.1+; the transition function will
  treat the binder as a let-bound undefined value until the
  existential-wrapping codegen lands. Authors using abstract binders
  with the Lean backend should expect a missing-identifier error
  until that wiring is in.

### `accounts` block

Declares the instruction's account context with attributes.

```fsharp
accounts {
  authority      : signer, writable
  vault          : writable, pda ["vault", authority]
  pool_vault     : writable, token, authority pool
  depositor_ta   : writable, type token
  mint           : readonly
  token_program  : program
  system_program : program
}
```

Account attributes:
- `signer` — must sign the transaction
- `writable` — mutable account
- `readonly` — immutable account
- `program` — program account
- `token` — SPL token account (shorthand)
- `type ident` — explicit account type
- `authority ident` — token authority reference
- `pda [seeds]` — PDA derivation inline

#### `<account>.pubkey` accessor

Inside effect / requires / ensures bodies, `<account_name>.pubkey` reads the
account's `Pubkey`. Use it to capture a signer's address into state or to
compare against a stored authority.

```fsharp
handler create (initial : U64) : State.Uninitialized -> State.Active {
  accounts {
    owner : signer
    vault : writable
  }
  effect {
    Active.owner   := owner.pubkey       // captures the signer's key
    Active.balance := initial
  }
}

handler deposit (amount : U64) : State.Active -> State.Active {
  auth owner
  accounts {
    owner : signer
    vault : writable
  }
  requires state.owner == owner.pubkey else Unauthorized
  // …
}
```

`<account>.pubkey` lowers to `ctx.<account>.key()` in Anchor handlers and to
the symbolic `Pubkey` slot in proptest / Kani. Inside a Lean transition
body it disappears — account-pubkey writes are dropped from the Lean
model (the proof obligation is about account identity, not byte value).

### `effect` block

State mutations using `:=` (assignment), `+=` (increment), `-=` (decrement).

```fsharp
effect {
  interest_rate       := rate
  total_deposits      += amount
  balance             -= fee
  counter             += 1
  accounts[i].capital += amount    // indexed LHS (per-field)
  accounts[i] := { active := 1, balance := 0 }   // indexed LHS (whole-record)
  state               := .Active { authority, V := 0, I := 0, F := 0,
                                   accounts := empty_map }   // constructor RHS
}
```

The indexed-LHS forms cover both per-field updates (`accounts[i].capital
+= amount` — change one field of an existing slot) and whole-record
replacement (`accounts[i] := { … }` — overwrite the whole slot). Use the
whole-record form to register a new Map entry from scratch; partial
record literals on the RHS require every field of the slot's record type
to be set, mirroring Rust's `let x: T = T { … }` exhaustiveness.

Values on the RHS may be integer literals, qualified paths, arithmetic
expressions, constructor applications (`.Variant payload`), record literals,
record updates, `match … with`, or built-in helpers like `mul_div_floor`.

#### Effect arithmetic

As of v2.7, `+=` / `-=` default to **checked** semantics *in both the
generated Anchor handler bodies AND the Kani model*. On overflow the
transition returns `false` (Kani model) or `.ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?`
(Anchor body) — mirroring what deployed Anchor programs do. Pre-v2.7 the
Anchor handler body lowered to `wrapping_add` which didn't match production.

Two explicit modifiers opt into alternative semantics when the handler
deliberately wants them:

| Operator | Semantics | Kani transition | Anchor handler body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+=`  | checked (default)   | `checked_add(..)` — `return false` on overflow | `.checked_add(..).ok_or(MathOverflow)?` |
| `+=!` | saturating          | `saturating_add(..)` | `.saturating_add(..)` |
| `+=?` | wrapping            | `wrapping_add(..)`   | `.wrapping_add(..)` |

(`-=` / `-=!` / `-=?` follow the same pattern.) Proptest harness keeps
`wrapping_*` for default `+=` in the "explore the full state space" mode;
`+=!` / `+=?` are honored verbatim regardless of harness.

Example:

```fsharp
effect {
  // default checked — reverts on overflow, matches deployed checked_add
  pool += amount

  // explicit saturating — clamps to u64::MAX instead of erroring
  fees_collected +=! delta

  // explicit wrapping — cursor/index field where modular arithmetic is intended
  nonce +=? 1
}
```

### `permissionless` clause

Marks a handler as deliberately unauthenticated. Opts out of the P1
`no_access_control` lint that otherwise fires for any handler missing
`auth X`. Common on DeFi primitives where *anyone* is supposed to call
the handler — user slot inits, deposits, donations.

```fsharp
handler init_user (user : Pubkey) {
  permissionless
  effect { balance := 0 }
}

handler deposit_collateral (i : AccountIdx) (amount : U128)
    : State.Active -> State.Active {
  permissionless
  effect { accounts[i].capital += amount }
}
```

Declaring both `auth X` AND `permissionless` on the same handler fires
a `contradictory_auth` P1 — pick one.

### `transfers` block

Token transfer declarations with source, destination, amount, and authority.

```fsharp
transfers {
  from initializer_ta to escrow_ta amount deposit_amount authority initializer
  from escrow_ta to taker_ta amount initializer_amount authority escrow
}
```

### `match` clause (guarded branches)

A handler can end in a `match { | cond => outcome | ... }` clause that
desugars to multiple synthetic handlers, one per arm. Arms dispatch on the
first matching boolean condition. Outcomes are `abort ErrorName`,
`effect { ... }`, or an empty body (no-op / state unchanged). The final arm
is typically `_ => ...` as a catch-all.

```fsharp
handler liquidate (i : AccountIdx) : State.Active -> State.Active {
  auth authority
  accounts { authority : signer, vault : writable }

  requires state.accounts[i].active == 1 else SlotInactive

  match
    | state.accounts[i].capital + state.accounts[i].pnl >= 0 =>
        abort AccountHealthy
    | state.accounts[i].capital + state.accounts[i].pnl + state.I >= 0 =>
        effect { accounts[i].active := 0 }
    | _ =>
        abort BankruptPosition
}
```

Each arm becomes its own case in the generated transition function and its
own preservation obligation per property — vacuous cases close trivially,
the real cases need proofs.

## Expressions

Guard expressions appear in `requires`, `ensures`, `property`, `invariant`,
`match` arms, and effect RHS positions. The full set of nodes parsed by the
chumsky grammar:

### Precedence (lowest to highest)

| Level | Operators |
|---|---|
| 1 | `or`, `\/` |
| 2 | `implies` |
| 3 | `and`, `/\` |
| 4 | `not` |
| 5 | `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `==` |
| 6 | `+`, `-` |
| 7 | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| 8 | postfix: `.field`, `is .Variant` |
| 9 | atoms: literals, paths, calls, `old(...)`, quantifiers, `match`, constructors, record literals, parenthesized |

### Atoms

```fsharp
// Integers (underscores allowed)
42
10_000_000

// Booleans (used in propositional positions)
true
false

// Qualified paths with optional subscripts
amount
state.balance
Pool.Active
state.approval_count
state.accounts[i].capital

// Pre-state reference (use inside `ensures` or `property` bodies)
//
// v2.23: a `property` whose body contains `old(...)` is a binary
// (pre / post) preservation predicate. Codegen emits
//   fn <prop>(pre: &State, post: &State) -> bool
// in proptest / Kani, and the per-handler preservation harness
// captures `let pre = s.clone(); let mut post = s;` before the
// handler call. Inside the body, `state.x` lowers to `post.x` and
// `old(state.x)` lowers to `pre.x`. A `property` body without
// `old(...)` keeps the legacy `fn <prop>(s: &State) -> bool` shape.
// Pre-v2.23 every preservation property silently lowered to a
// structural tautology (`s.x cmp s.x`) — fixed structurally; the
// `vacuous_property_lowering` lint guards against regression.
old(state.balance)
old(state.accounts[i].pnl)

// Quantifiers — single binder
forall s : Pool.Active, s.total_deposits >= s.total_borrows
exists l : Loan.Active, l.collateral > 0

// Quantifiers — multi-binder (desugars to nested single-binder forms)
forall p1 p2 : Path, black_count(p1) == black_count(p2)

// Lowering notes:
//   - `implies`  Lean: → ; Rust: `(!a) || (b)` — valid in property fn bodies.
//   - `forall i : Fin[N], …` (e.g. over an index alias like `AccountIdx`)
//     lowers to a real per-slot harness — see `property` below.
//   - `exists i : Fin[N], …` (bounded; directly or via an index alias)
//     lowers to Lean `∃` and Rust `(0..N).any(|i| …)`. Works in
//     `requires` / `ensures` / `property` bodies. An *unbounded* `exists`
//     (e.g. `exists v : U64, …`) can't be enumerated — it keeps the
//     `/* QEDGEN_UNSUPPORTED_QUANTIFIER */` marker and the `property` fn
//     returns `true`; bound the binder with a `Fin[N]` index type.
//   - Nested quantifiers still emit the marker — split into single-binder
//     properties.

// Aggregate sum over a bounded index type
sum i : AccountIdx, state.accounts[i].capital

// The body of a `sum` is a plain expression (no conditionals). To count
// active entries when `active` is a 0/1 discriminator, sum the field
// directly — `if state.accounts[i].active == 1 then 1 else 0` is not
// grammatical. Example:
//   num_active == sum i : AccountIdx, state.accounts[i].active

// Parenthesized
(amount + fee) * rate

// Let-in binding — derive a value once, reference it by name.
// Lowers to Lean's `let x := v; body`, Rust `{ let x = v; body }`.
// Useful in ensures to name the quantity you're asserting about:
ensures let delta = old(state.balance) - state.balance in delta == amount
```

### Constructors, record literals, record updates

```fsharp
// Bare constructor — variant without payload
.Uninitialized

// Constructor with record-literal payload
.Active { authority, V := deposit_amount, I := 0, F := 0 }

// Record literal — useful as a Map-value RHS
{ active := 1, capital := amount, reserved_pnl := 0, pnl := 0, fee_credits := 0 }

// Record update — `{ base with f := v, ... }`
{ state.accounts[i] with capital := state.accounts[i].capital + amount }
```

Record updates are the compact form for touching a few fields of a sum-typed
record without restating the rest. Generated Lean renders this to native
`{ base with ... }` syntax so Mathlib's update lemmas apply.

### `is .Variant` — constructor test

Postfix `is .Variant` yields a `Prop` that's true when the LHS was built with
the given variant. Preferred over a full `match` when you only need the
discriminator check.

```fsharp
requires state.accounts[i] is .Active else SlotInactive
```

### `match … with` expression

An inline `match` expression yields a value (contrast with the handler-level
`match` clause above, which dispatches entire handler bodies). Arms name the
payload binder when destructuring.

```fsharp
let authority =
  match state with
    | .Active a => a.authority
    | .Draining => 0
    | .Resetting => 0
```

### `mul_div_floor` / `mul_div_ceil` — fixed-point helpers

```fsharp
requires mul_div_floor(size_q, exec_price, POS_SCALE) <= MAX_ACCOUNT_NOTIONAL
ensures state.F == old(state.F) + mul_div_ceil(fee, numerator, denominator)
```

Integer VMs (EVM, Solana sBPF) have no native fixed-point arithmetic and
users writing `(a * b) / d` by hand routinely get the widen-before-divide
step wrong. These helpers are built-in so the spec, the generated Rust
(promoted to `u256`/`U512` locally), and the Lean proof (using Mathlib
`mul_div_cancel` / `Nat.div_add_mod` lemmas) all agree on exact semantics.

### Function application

```fsharp
forall n : Node, left(n).key < n.key and n.key < right(n).key
forall n : Node, left(parent(n)) == n or right(parent(n)) == n
```

`f(a, b, ...)` parses as `Expr::App` with the function name left abstract.
Spec-level helpers (`parent`, `left`, `right`, `black_count`, …) are
declared as uninterpreted symbols in the generated Lean support module —
users can then prove properties about them with hand-written lemmas.
Zero-arg user-defined calls are rejected; bare identifiers parse as paths.

### `now()` — on-chain timestamp builtin (v2.21)

```fsharp
requires state.last_update + REFRESH_INTERVAL <= now() else TooSoon
effect { last_update := now() }
```

`now()` is the one zero-arg builtin. It returns a fresh symbolic `u64`
timestamp:

- **Rust:** lowers to `(solana_program::clock::Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp as u64)`.
- **Lean:** lowers to the axiomatized symbol `QEDGen.Solana.Valid.now : Nat`
  (re-exported as bare `now` from `QEDGen.Solana`). Proofs that depend
  on specific timestamps discharge against this axiom.
- **Kani / proptest:** lowers to `kani::any::<u64>()` / `any::<u64>()`
  so the harness explores arbitrary timestamps.

Use it sparingly — most handler-time freshness checks are easier to
prove when the timestamp is a handler parameter, since the proof can
case-split on the param. `now()` exists for the cases where threading a
parameter is awkward (e.g. permissionless refreshers).

### Postfix `.field`

`.field` applies to any expression, not just bare paths:

```fsharp
left(n).key          // Field on the result of a function call
parent(n).color      // Chained
```

Bare dotted paths (`a.b.c`) still route to `Expr::Path`; `.field` on a
non-path base produces `Expr::Field`.

## Properties, invariants, cover, liveness

### `property` — quantified preservation properties

Generates per-handler sub-lemmas + a master inductive theorem. `preserved_by`
names the handler scope.

> **Syntax — positional order matters.** The form is
> `property <name> : <expr> preserved_by <scope>`. Writing the scope before
> the body (`property name preserved_by [...] : expr`) parse-errors.

```fsharp
// Preserved by all handlers
property conservation :
  state.V >= (sum i : AccountIdx, state.accounts[i].capital)
           + (sum i : AccountIdx, state.accounts[i].reserved_pnl)
           + state.I + state.F
  preserved_by all

// Preserved by specific handlers
property vault_bounded :
  state.V <= MAX_VAULT_TVL
  preserved_by [deposit, top_up_insurance, deposit_fee_credits]

// v2.24: preserved by every handler except the listed ones — the common
// "every handler other than the one whose job is to break it" pattern.
// Expands at adapt time to the full handler list minus the excludes.
property still_unpaused :
  state.paused == 0
  preserved_by all except [pause]

// Quantified over a type
property account_solvent :
  forall i : AccountIdx,
    state.accounts[i].active == 1
      implies state.accounts[i].capital + state.accounts[i].pnl >= 0
  preserved_by all
```

### `invariant` — named state invariants

Either a quantified expression (emitted as a proof obligation) or a string
description (kept as documentation for Lean and generated reports).

```fsharp
invariant collateral_backing :
  forall l : Loan.Active, l.collateral > 0

invariant conservation "total tokens preserved across initialize, exchange, cancel"

invariant pda_integrity "derived PDA matches provided account on initialize"
```

#### Handler linkage: `invariant Foo` vs `establishes Foo`

When a handler block carries one of:

- **`invariant Foo`** — the handler *preserves* `Foo`. Generated Kani / proptest
  harnesses assume `Foo` holds pre-transition and assert it holds post-transition.
- **`establishes Foo`** — the handler *establishes* `Foo`. Harnesses skip the
  pre-assume and only assert post. Use for init handlers (the system isn't yet
  in a state where `Foo` could meaningfully hold), one-shot graduations that
  elevate an invariant after the fact, or any transition whose contract is
  "outcome only, no precondition."

```fsharp
invariant root_set :
  state.root != ZERO_ROOT

handler init : State.Active -> State.Active {
  establishes root_set
  effect { root := <derived_pda> }
}

handler update : State.Active -> State.Active {
  invariant root_set       // preserves: assume root_set pre, assert post
  requires state.root != ZERO_ROOT
  effect { root := <new_root> }
}
```

Both forms generate per-handler harnesses (Kani `verify_X_preserves_Y` /
`verify_X_establishes_Y`, proptest `X_preserves_Y` / `X_establishes_Y`) when
the invariant has a Rust-renderable body. Description-only invariants
(string form) stay documentation-only and emit no Rust harness.

The Lean side currently emits the invariant as a standalone predicate-stated
theorem; per-handler Lean preservation theorems for invariants are not yet
emitted (the Rust harnesses are the active gate today). State-machine
`property` blocks with `preserved_by` still produce Lean per-handler theorems.

### `cover` — reachability

Declares that a sequence of handlers is reachable. Generates existential
proofs (Lean) and `kani::cover!` harnesses.

```fsharp
// One-liner trace
cover happy_path [initialize, exchange]
cover cancel_path [initialize, cancel]
cover bulk_insert [initialize, insert, insert, insert]

// Block form with trace and/or reachable clauses
cover cancel_available {
  trace [create_vault, propose, reject, cancel_proposal]
  reachable cancel_proposal when state.approval_count > 0
}
```

### `liveness` — bounded leads-to

From state A, state B is reachable within N steps via specified handlers.

```fsharp
liveness escrow_settles : State.Open ~> State.Closed via [exchange, cancel] within 1

liveness drain_completes : State.Draining ~> State.Active
  via [complete_drain, reset] within 2
```

## Environment (external state)

Declares external state mutations that happen outside handlers (oracle feeds,
clock ticks, admin pokes). Properties that reference mutated fields must hold
across those mutations too.

```fsharp
environment interest_rate_change {
  mutates interest_rate : U64
  constraint interest_rate > 0
}
```

## Pragmas

`pragma <name> { <items> }` wraps platform-specific declarations in a named
namespace. Pragmas keep the core DSL platform-agnostic: constructs that only
make sense for one target live inside their pragma block, not at the top
level.

```fsharp
pragma sbpf { ... }    // sBPF assembly programs
```

The presence of `pragma sbpf` also selects the assembly target — no explicit
`target` keyword needed. Absent → framework-flavored Rust (the
default qedspec target). Framework selection happens at codegen
time via `qedgen init --target {anchor,quasar,...}`, not in the
spec — the same `.qedspec` drives every framework target.

Body whitelist for `pragma sbpf`: `const`, `pubkey`, `instruction`, `errors`.
Core DSL items (`handler`, `type`, `property`, `invariant`, `interface`, …)
stay at the top level.

### Assignment pragmas — `pragma <key> = <value>`

Scalar codegen directives that tune *how* a spec lowers, without a body:

```fsharp
pragma checked_overflow_error = MathOverflow   // error returned on a checked-add overflow
pragma state_repr = adt                        // inductive multi-variant State (see below)
```

**`pragma state_repr = adt`** — opt a multi-variant `type State | A | B of { … } | C`
into the inductive representation: Lean lowers it to a real `inductive State` (with
per-variant payload + match-based transitions) and Anchor Rust to the wrapper-struct +
inner-enum shape. **Absent (the default), a multi-variant State lowers flat** — a
`structure State` carrying every variant's fields plus a `status : Status` discriminant.
The flat form auto-discharges more proof obligations (abort / liveness / overflow), so
prefer it unless you specifically want the inductive sum-type modeling.

> Before v2.33 this choice was keyed implicitly on whether the spec declared a
> `WrongState` error variant — so adding or removing a lifecycle error silently flipped
> the State representation. The pragma makes it explicit. `WrongState` keeps its
> independent role as the error returned on a variant-mismatch fallthrough.

## Interface declarations

Contracts for programs you CPI into. Uniform surface across three tiers:

- **Tier 0** — shape only: `program_id`, handler discriminant, accounts, args.
  Generated by `qedgen interface --idl target/idl/program.json`.
- **Tier 1** — hand-authored `requires` / `ensures` on handlers. The
  caller gets real hypotheses at each `call` site, bound into
  proptest and Kani obligations from the same source. (When the caller
  also has a Lean side, Tier-1 clauses become Lean hypotheses there
  too — but Lean is optional for CPI contracts.)
- **Tier 2** — the interface is a real imported `.qedspec` (v2.6+). No
  `interface` keyword needed — every handler in the imported spec is public.

**Drift caution on Tier-1 growth.** Keep `requires`/`ensures` clauses
**semantic** — invariants that describe program-visible behavior —
rather than **implementation-tracking** — clauses that pin specific fee
math, byte layouts, or error codes that the upstream may change. An
`ensures amount > 0` survives upstream patches. An `ensures fee ==
amount * 30 / 10_000` rots the first time the upstream bumps a fee
parameter. When in doubt about whether a clause is durable, prefer
fewer clauses plus a Kani harness against the deployed binary over
more clauses that need rewriting with every upstream release.

```fsharp
interface Token {
  program_id "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"

  upstream {
    package       "spl-token"
    version       "4.0.3"
    binary_hash   "sha256:..."      // deployed .so, authoritative
    verified_with ["proptest", "kani"]  // honest — "lean" only when proven
    verified_at   "2026-04-18"
  }

  handler transfer (amount : U64) {
    discriminant "0x03"
    accounts {
      from      : writable, type token
      to        : writable, type token
      authority : signer
    }
    requires amount > 0
    ensures  amount > 0
  }
}
```

See `docs/design/spec-composition.md` §2 for the tier model and
`interfaces/spl_token.qedspec` for the canonical SPL Token interface.

### `call Target.handler(name = expr, ...)` clause

Inside a handler body, a `call` is a terminal statement — the uniform CPI
surface. Not an expression, not nestable.

```fsharp
handler exchange : State.Open -> State.Closed {
  call Token.transfer(
    from      = taker_ta,
    to        = initializer_ta,
    amount    = taker_amount,
    authority = taker,
  )
  emits EscrowExchanged
}
```

`qedgen check` emits `[shape_only_cpi]` on calls whose target declares no
`ensures` — the visible gap between "my Rust compiles" and "my program is
verified."

## Cross-program patterns

Two distinct "another program" stories share the `import` keyword:

1. **Importing a callee interface** for CPI ensures. The imported source
   declares an `interface <Name> { ... }` block; the consumer's `call
   Target.handler(...)` substitutes the callee's `ensures` at the call
   site. The bundled SPL Token / System Program / Metaplex stubs ship this
   way. See [`references/qedspec-imports.md`](./qedspec-imports.md) for the
   full manifest / lock / `--frozen` surface.
2. **Importing another program's data shape** for cross-program account
   reads (v2.29). The imported source is a full qedspec carrying `type`
   declarations; the consumer binds a foreign account via `acct : type
   Foreign.State` and reads fields directly. No CPI is involved — just the
   shared data shape. Covered below.

### Importing another program's spec

When a handler reads from an account owned by another program (a config
PDA, a registry, a state structure shared between programs in a suite),
import that program's qedspec by `dep_key` and bind the account to one
of its imported `type` declarations.

```fsharp
spec MyConsumer

import Foreign from "foreign_program"        // dep_key in qed.toml

handler do_thing : State.Active -> State.Active {
  accounts {
    signer       : signer
    foreign_acct : type Foreign.State        // <- imported account type
    state        : writable
  }
  requires foreign_acct.admin == signer.pubkey else Unauthorized
  effect { last_admin_seen := foreign_acct.admin }
}
```

The `from` string is the same `dep_key` shape `qed.toml` uses to resolve
CPI imports — the resolver picks the data-shape path automatically when
the imported source declares `type` blocks but no `interface` block /
handlers. See `qedspec-imports.md` for the path / github / version-pin
surface; everything below is consumer-side only.

#### Resolver surface (Slice F)

After `qedgen check` resolves an `import` whose source declares `type`
blocks, the parsed spec gains an `imported_namespaces[Foreign]` entry
that records the dep_key, the imported account types, and any plain
record types they reference. `qed.lock` then carries an
`imported_account_type_names` field (comma-joined, sorted) for every
import so a renamed or removed foreign type surfaces under `qedgen check
--frozen` with the same kind of before/after line as a changed
`spec_hash`.

#### Account binding: `acct : type Foreign.State`

In handler `accounts { ... }` blocks, an account attribute of the form
`type <Namespace>.<TypeName>` binds the account to an imported account
type. The dotted form is parsed as a single `AccountAttr::Type`; the
adapter splits on `.` and records `imported_namespace = Some("Foreign")`
on the parsed handler-account. A `validate_imported_account_refs` pass
(after import resolution) bails with a known-namespaces / known-types
hint if either side is unknown.

Bare-type bindings (`type token`, `type State`) keep their pre-v2.29
single-ident semantics — no dotted form, no namespace lookup.

#### Field reads in `requires` / `ensures`

Once an account binds to an imported type, references like
`foreign_acct.admin` and `foreign_acct.counter` in `requires` / `ensures`
lower against the local mirror codegen emits at `src/imported/<ns>.rs`
(Slice H — see below). The bind-state pass routes the field through:

- **Flat-struct mirrors** → `ctx.foreign_acct.admin` (Anchor
  `Account<'info, T>` auto-derefs the `T` body).
- **Multi-variant ADT mirrors** → `(*ctx.foreign_acct.inner.admin())`
  (routes through the v2.29 Slice B accessor that returns `&Pubkey`).

The user writes `foreign_acct.admin` in both cases; the lowering picks
the right shape from the imported type's declaration.

#### Local mirror (Slice H)

`qedgen codegen --target anchor` materializes every imported account
type as a local Rust module at `src/imported/<ns>.rs`, plus a
`src/imported/mod.rs` re-exporter. `lib.rs` gains `pub mod imported;`
whenever any imported namespace is non-empty. Two shapes are mirrored:

- **Single-variant account types** → plain `#[account] pub struct
  <Name> { ... }` with the same Anchor derive set the local state
  uses (plus the lifecycle `status: u8` + `enum <Name>Status` when
  the imported type declares lifecycle states).
- **Multi-variant ADT account types** → wrapper struct + inner enum +
  the v2.29 Slice B accessor methods. Field reads via
  `imported_acct.inner.<field>()` resolve through the same shape
  used for locally-declared multi-variant state.

Plain record types referenced by the imported account types are emitted
in the same file so the mirror is self-contained — no cross-file `use
crate::imported::<other>::*;` chasing. The mirror is fully owned by
codegen; do not hand-edit `src/imported/`.

#### Backcompat — bundled CPI stubs

The bundled SPL Token / System Program / Metaplex stubs declare *no*
`type` blocks — they're interface-only, used solely for CPI ensures.
`import Token from "spl"` continues to route through the existing CPI
import path; the data-shape resolver path stays empty (no
`imported_namespaces` entry, no `src/imported/Token.rs` mirror). Mixing
the two is fine in the same spec: import some namespaces for CPI
ensures and others for data shape; resolution dispatches per-import on
what the imported source actually declares.

#### Limitations in v2.29

- **Anchor target only.** Imported-namespace account types lower to
  `Account<'info, crate::imported::<ns>::<T>>` on Anchor. The Quasar
  target falls back to the pre-v2.29 path (`UncheckedAccount`); the
  Pinocchio runtime work is deferred behind the v2.24 Pinocchio
  backends (an `ImportedOwnerCheck` audit site + bytemuck
  deserialization stub are reserved for that follow-up).
- **Lean ∀-quantification of imported fields is not yet wired.** The
  consumer's handler theorem statement does not quantify over the
  imported account's fields in v2.29 — proofs that reference
  `foreign_acct.admin` from Lean show as an undefined identifier
  until v2.29.1 closes the wiring (same scope as the Slice A
  `abstract <name>` binder Lean gap).
- **Kani / proptest symbolic init for imported fields is opt-in.**
  The current paths don't emit `kani::any()` for imported account
  fields automatically; only reachable when a property explicitly
  quantifies over an imported field. Documented gap for v2.29.1+.

## sBPF-specific constructs (inside `pragma sbpf { ... }`)

Everything in this section lives inside `pragma sbpf { ... }`. The pragma
wrapping is mandatory in v2.5; the grammar rejects these items at the top
level. See `examples/sbpf/tree/tree.qedspec` for a full example.

```fsharp
pragma sbpf {
  pubkey SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID [0, 0, 0, 0]
  pubkey RENT_SYSVAR_ID    [0x6a7d51..., 0xb8b9f5..., 0xc01b2f..., 0xb85e22...]

  errors [
    InvalidDiscriminant        = 1  "Discriminant is not REGISTER_MARKET",
    InvalidInstructionLength   = 2  "Instruction data is not 1 byte",
  ]

  instruction register_market { ... }
}
```

### `pubkey NAME [u64, u64, u64, u64]`

32-byte pubkeys as four `U64` chunks — the form the sBPF program will compare
against in registers.

### `errors [ NAME = CODE "msg", ... ]`

Error list used for exit-code reasoning in sBPF properties. Anchor-style
programs use `type Error | ...` at the top level instead — this sugar is
sBPF-only.

### `instruction NAME { ... }` block

Groups discriminant, entry point, layouts, guards, and properties for a
single sBPF instruction. Any of the sub-clauses is optional.

```fsharp
instruction register_market {
  discriminant 0
  entry 0

  const QUOTE_MINT_OFFSET = 32

  errors [InvalidDiscriminant = 1, InvalidLength = 2]

  input_layout {
    discriminant : U8     @0  "Instruction discriminant"
    base_mint    : Pubkey @1
    quote_mint   : Pubkey @33
  }

  insn_layout {
    opcode : U8  @0
    amount : U64 @1
  }

  guard check_discriminant {
    checks discriminant == 0
    error InvalidDiscriminant
    fuel 8
  }

  guard check_length {
    checks instruction_data_len == 1
    error InvalidLength
    fuel 4
  }

  property rejects_wrong_discriminant {
    expr discriminant != 0 implies exit_code == 1
    scope guards
    exit 1
  }
}
```

### `input_layout { ... }` and `insn_layout { ... }`

Field declarations of the form `name : Type @ offset "doc"` (description
optional). `input_layout` describes the input buffer; `insn_layout` describes
the instruction-data register's memory layout.

### `guard NAME { ... }` block

A single validation check. `checks` is the guard predicate, `error` names the
failure code, `fuel` bounds the sBPF execution steps needed to close the
goal.

```fsharp
guard check_discriminant {
  checks discriminant == 0
  error InvalidDiscriminant
  fuel 8
}
```

### sBPF `property NAME { ... }` block

sBPF property blocks can carry additional clauses that drive the sBPF
WP-based proof backend:

| Clause | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `expr` | Property expression | `expr amount > 0` |
| `preserved_by` | Handler scope | `preserved_by all` or `preserved_by [h1, h2]` |
| `scope guards` | Scope to all guard blocks | `scope guards` |
| `scope [names]` | Scope to specific guards/instructions | `scope [check_disc, check_len]` |
| `flow name from seeds [...]` | Data flow from PDA seeds | `flow market from seeds [base_mint, quote_mint]` |
| `flow name through [...]` | Data flow through registers | `flow amount through [r2, r3]` |
| `cpi program target { ... }` | Expected CPI envelope | see below |
| `after all guards` | Property asserted after all guards pass | `after all guards` |
| `exit N` | Expected exit code | `exit 0` |

```fsharp
property rejects_wrong_account_count {
  expr accounts.count != 3 implies exit_code == 1
  scope guards
  exit 1
}

property accepts_valid_transfer {
  expr all_guards_pass implies exit_code == 0
  scope [transfer_sol]
  after all guards
  exit 0
}
```

### CPI envelope block (inside sBPF `property`)

```fsharp
property transfer_cpi_correct {
  cpi system_program transfer {
    accounts [sender, recipient, system_program]
    data amount
  }
  after all guards
  exit 0
}
```

## `#[qed(verified, ...)]` drift attribute

QEDGen codegen stamps each generated Rust handler with a `#[qed]` attribute
that binds it to its spec contract. At compile time the proc macro reads the
referenced spec, re-hashes the handler block, and emits `compile_error!` on
mismatch.

```rust
#[qed(verified,
      spec      = "../../percolator.qedspec",
      handler   = "deposit",
      hash      = "3f2c9a81b0d5e4f7",   // body content hash
      spec_hash = "7e1a48d93b2c0f65")]  // spec-handler content hash
pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<Deposit>, i: u64, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
    // ... user-filled body
}
```

Args:
- `spec` — path (relative to the `.rs` file) to the `.qedspec` source
- `handler` — handler name inside the spec
- `hash` — SHA-256-hex16 of the function signature + body (set by
  `qedgen check --drift --update-hashes`)
- `spec_hash` — SHA-256-hex16 of the spec-side `handler <name> { ... }`
  block text (set by codegen and by `qedgen reconcile --update-hashes`)

See SKILL.md **Step 4d — drift reconciliation** for the full agent workflow
and `references/cli.md` for `qedgen reconcile` / `qedgen check --drift`.

## `qedgen check` coverage

Prints a verification matrix showing which handlers are covered by which
properties.

```fsharp
$ qedgen check --spec multisig.qedspec --coverage

handler           threshold_bounded votes_bounded
-------------------------------------------------
create_vault              Y               Y
propose                   Y               Y
approve                   Y               Y
reject                    Y               Y
execute                   Y               Y
cancel_proposal           Y               Y
remove_member             Y               -

Coverage: 100% (7/7 handlers covered by at least one property)
```

## What `qedgen codegen` generates

From a `.qedspec`, codegen produces:

- **Rust handler skeleton** (default, Anchor-compatible): program crate,
  `guards.rs` (always regenerated), `src/instructions/*.rs` (user-owned,
  scaffolded once), `src/lib.rs` (user-owned, scaffolded once),
  `errors.rs`, entrypoint. Generated `Cargo.toml` includes
  TODO-commented `anchor-lang` / `anchor-spl` / `qedgen-macros` deps —
  uncomment after reviewing.
- **Lean proofs** (`--lean`): `Spec.lean` (always regenerated) +
  `Proofs.lean` (bootstrapped once — user-owned tactic bodies)
- **Kani harnesses** (`--kani`): BMC harnesses for each property + overflow
  detection
- **Proptest suites** (`--proptest`): randomised testing of all properties
- **Unit tests** (`--test`): Rust unit tests for handler logic
- **Integration tests** (`--integration`): in-process SVM integration tests
- **CI workflows** (`--ci`): GitHub Actions workflow for the verification
  waterfall

`qedgen codegen --spec program.qedspec --all` generates everything. See
`references/cli.md` for the scaffold-once policy, drift attributes, and the
require-git guard.

## qedguards Lean macro

For direct Lean proof authoring on sBPF programs, the `qedguards` macro
generates guard-chain infrastructure. This is the Lean-side companion to
`.qedspec` `instruction` blocks.

```lean
import QEDGen.Solana.Guards

qedguards Dropset where
  prog: progAt
  chunks progAt_0 progAt_1 progAt_2

  errors
    E_DISCRIMINANT 100
    E_QUOTE_MINT   200

  offsets
    DISCRIMINANT_OFFSET "0"
    QUOTE_MINT_OFFSET   "0x20"

  guard P1 "wrong discriminant"
    offset: DISCRIMINANT_OFFSET
    expected: DISCRIMINANT_REGISTER_MARKET
    fuel 8
    error E_DISCRIMINANT
    proof auto

  guard P9 "quote mint mismatch chunk 0"
    offset: QUOTE_MINT_C0_OFFSET
    expected_reg: EXPECTED_QUOTE_MINT_C0_OFFSET
    fuel 12
    error E_QUOTE_MINT
    proof phased [phase1_prefix 4, phase2_ptr_arith 3, phase3_read 5]
```

### qedguards clauses

| Clause | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `prog:` | Program definition or fetch function |
| `chunks` | Sub-program chunk defs for dsimp |
| `entry:` | Entry PC (optional, for non-zero entrypoints) |
| `r1:` / `r2:` | Register bindings (optional) |
| `errors` | Error code constants (`NAME value`) |
| `offsets` | Offset constants (`NAME "intValue"`) |
| `guard NAME "description"` | Guard declaration |
| `fuel N` | Execution fuel for this guard |
| `error NAME` | Error code on failure |
| `proof auto` | Auto-generate `wp_exec` proof |
| `proof phased [...]` | Phase decomposition with fuel per phase |
| `proof sorry` | Stub only (default) |

### What qedguards generates

- Offset constants + `@[simp] theorem ea_NAME` lemmas
- Error-code abbreviations
- `Spec` structure with rejection theorem types
- For `proof auto`: full `wp_exec` proofs with hypothesis lifting
- For `proof phased`: main composition theorem + phase `sorry` stubs

## qedbridge Lean macro

Refinement bridge connecting qedspec (abstract state) to sBPF bytecode
(concrete memory).

```lean
import QEDGen.Solana.Bridge

qedbridge Escrow where
  input: r1
  insn: r2        -- optional: instruction data register
  entry: 0        -- optional: entry PC
  fuel: 100

  layout
    maker     Pubkey at 0
    amount    U64   at 32
    status    U8    at 40

  status_encoding at 40
    Open      0
    Completed 1
    Cancelled 2

  operations
    cancel    0x01
    exchange  0x02 takes: taker_amount U64
```

### What qedbridge generates

- Memory layout constants (byte offsets)
- Status encoding/decoding functions
- `encodeState : State -> Nat -> Mem -> Prop` (state-memory correspondence)
- `decodeState : Nat -> Mem -> State` (functional read)
- Per-operation refinement theorems (sorry stubs):
  - `OpName.refines`: if abstract transition succeeds, execution exits 0 and
    encodes the new state
  - `OpName.rejects`: if abstract transition fails, execution exits non-zero
