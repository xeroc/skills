# Online Shopping Research

The whole purpose of this skill: save the user time and money when shopping online. Answer three things: what is a fair price, where to buy, and whether the shop can be trusted.

For best results run this skill with the Fable 5 model — it is very smart and already knows a lot about products, pricing, and shops.

Research only. Never place orders, enter payment or address details, or create shop accounts.

Non-negotiable: every response to the user is very concise, clear, and formatted in nice readable markdown. The How to answer section is a hard contract — check every response against it before sending.

## Setup

- Read `DEEPAPI_API_KEY` and `DEEPAPI_API_BASE_URL` from the environment. If unset, try `source ~/.deepapi/env`; the default base URL is `https://deepapi.co`.
- If the key is missing, stop and tell the user to get one at https://deepapi.co.
- Never print, log, or expose the key.

## DeepAPI

Use DeepAPI for all shopping research — not built-in search tools. Mix the endpoints however the task needs:

| Endpoint | Use for | maxCostUsd |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/search/web` | find shops, prices, deals, reviews — run ~3 query variants | `"0.05"` |
| `POST /v1/scrape/website` | read the exact product page or listing the user is checking; verify an unknown shop | `"0.20"` |
| `POST /v1/research/deep` | pricing or market questions search cannot settle | `"0.10"` |
| `POST /v1/scrape/twitter/search` | real buyer complaints about a shop | `"0.03"` |

Every request: `Authorization: Bearer $DEEPAPI_API_KEY`, `Content-Type: application/json`, a unique `Idempotency-Key` per POST, and an explicit `maxCostUsd`.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$DEEPAPI_API_BASE_URL/v1/search/web" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: shop-$(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"query": "Sony WH-1000XM5 price Germany", "maxResults": 5, "maxCostUsd": "0.05"}'
```

If `status: running`, poll `GET /v1/requests/{requestId}` after `next.afterSecs`. On HTTP 402, ask the user to top up at https://deepapi.co/credits.

## How to research

Use your judgment. The goal is a confident answer, not a fixed procedure.

ALWAYS open with first impressions — before ANY web search, scrape, or deep research, no matter the item or its price. In one or two sentences, react to whatever the user provided (screenshot, link, description) from your own knowledge: does it look like a good deal, is the seller reputable, what is the typical price range — anything useful that comes to mind. The user must never sit waiting with nothing to read.

Extract the shopping intent early. Right after first impressions, make sure you know why the user is buying: what the item is for, who it's for, and what matters most to them (price, quality, delivery speed). Infer it from the conversation or screenshot when you can; if it's unclear and would change your recommendation, ask one short question. Knowing the real intent is how you help the user make the best possible purchase — not just find the lowest price.

Then scale research effort to the item's price. A cheap item researched for minutes is this skill failing its purpose:

- **Obvious call** — the screenshot or conversation already gives you enough to judge: answer right away. Zero searches, zero scrapes.
- **Cheap (roughly under $50)**: answer from your own knowledge — you already know what everyday items cost. At most ONE quick web search, and only if genuinely unsure. Scraping and deep research are forbidden in this tier. Respect the user's time above all: answer even more quickly, clearly, and concisely than usual.
- **Mid-range**: a few searches, scrape the listing and a top competitor or two.
- **Expensive ($1,000+)**: full depth — deep research, many search variants, scrape several shops and buyer reviews.

First impression example: "Cars of this brand and year usually go for €18-25k, so this looks slightly high — running a deep check to verify."

Then, as needed for the price tier:

- Identify the exact item from the conversation or the attached photo/screenshot.
- Infer the delivery country from the conversation or screenshot. If unclear, ask where it should be delivered. Search shops in that country or nearby ones with sensible shipping — whatever makes sense for that user.
- For branded merch, check for an official store first; if none exists, suggest reputable print-on-demand shops and say the item is unofficial.
- Avoid scam and dropshipping shops: too-good-to-be-true prices, no company info, fake urgency, weeks-long shipping from a "local" shop. Verify unknown shops before recommending them.

## How to answer

The format below is a hard rule, not a preference. Draft the response, check it against this list, and rewrite it if it fails any point:

- Very concise: the whole answer fits on one screen. Short sentences. Plain English.
- No filler, no hedging, no research narration ("I searched for...", "Let me check..."). Conclusions only.
- Nice readable markdown: a bold verdict line first, then short bullets or a small table. Never a wall of text, never long paragraphs.
- Verdict up top — good deal, fair, or overpriced — with the fair price range.
- Best 2-3 places to buy: links + local-currency prices.
- Only quote prices you actually found. Say it plainly when results are thin.
- Don't report research costs unless the user asks.

Shape every answer like this:

```markdown
**Verdict: Overpriced — fair price is €280–€330, this listing asks €449.**

| Buy from | Price |
|---|---|
| [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/...) | €289 |
| [mediamarkt.de](https://www.mediamarkt.de/...) | €299 |

Skip shiny-deals24.shop — €99 for this item is a classic scam price.
```

Success looks like this: the user found the right product quickly and bought it from a trusted, reputable shop at a good deal — not from an overpriced reseller or dropshipping store.
