# Release Notes & Changelog Generator

This skill analyzes git repositories to generate **end-user friendly** release notes and changelogs. It reads actual code diffs (not just commit messages), understands what changed, consolidates related changes, and produces clean markdown suitable for Slack updates and program documentation.

## Key Differentiators

- **Diff-Based Analysis**: Reads actual code changes, not just commit messages
- **End-User Focus**: No technical jargon, functions, or variables in output
- **Smart Consolidation**: If something changed back and forth with no net result, it's not mentioned
- **Final State Only**: Shows what the end result is, not intermediate steps
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Automatically flags breaking changes from commits and diffs
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Multi-Remote Support**: GitHub, Bitbucket, and local git repositories

## Capabilities

- **Tag-to-Tag Analysis**: Generate notes between any two release tags (e.g., v1.0.0 to v1.1.0)
- **Since-Last-Tag**: Automatically detect last tag and show changes since then
- **Recent Commits**: Analyze last N commits for quick updates
- **Full Diff Reading**: Understand actual code changes, not vague commit messages
- **Change Consolidation**: Merge related changes, eliminate flip-flop changes
- **Category Bucketing**: Organize into Features, Enhancements, Bug Fixes, Changes, Breaking Changes, Others
- **Slack-Ready Output**: Formatted markdown with bullet points and optional footnotes
- **Footnotes Support**: Add setup notes or important info without exposing secrets

## Output Categories

Changes are organized into these buckets:

| Category             | Description                       | When Used                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Features**     | Brand new functionality           | New screens, new buttons, new capabilities              |
| **Enhancements**     | Improvements to existing features | Faster, better, more options                            |
| **Bug Fixes**        | Issues that were resolved         | Things that weren't working now work                    |
| **Changes**          | Modifications to behavior         | Something works differently now                         |
| **Breaking Changes** | Changes requiring user action     | Must update settings, data migration needed             |
| **Others**           | Miscellaneous updates             | Documentation, internal improvements users might notice |

## Input Requirements

The skill needs:

1. **Repository Path** (optional): Defaults to current directory
2. **Range Specification** (one of):
   - `from_tag` and `to_tag`: Compare between two tags
   - `since_tag`: Everything since a specific tag to HEAD
   - `last_n_commits`: Analyze recent N commits (default: 50)
3. **Remote Type** (optional): `github`, `bitbucket`, or `local` (auto-detected)

**Input Formats Accepted**:

Natural language:

- "Generate release notes from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0"
- "What changed since the last release?"
- "Show me what's new in the last 30 commits"

Structured JSON:

```json
{
  "repo_path": "C:\\Projects\\MyApp",
  "from_tag": "v1.0.0",
  "to_tag": "v1.1.0"
}
```

## Output Format

Markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
# Release Notes - v1.1.0

## New Features

- Added dark mode toggle in settings
- New export to PDF option in reports

## Enhancements

- Improved loading speed when opening large files
- Search now finds partial matches

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where login would fail on slow connections
- Resolved crash when uploading files over 10MB

## Changes

- Settings menu has been reorganized for clarity
- Default file format changed from CSV to Excel

## Breaking Changes

- Database format updated - run migration tool before upgrading

---

**Notes:**

- Dark mode requires display driver update on Windows 7
- PDF export needs Adobe Reader installed
```

## How the Analysis Works

### Step 1: Gather Commits

Collects all commits in the specified range from the git repository.

### Step 2: Read git log and changes to apps/docs/beans

For each commit, reads the actual changes to apps/docs/beans.
Additionally, read changes to programs/ to identify breaking changes!

### Step 3: Interpret Changes

Translates technical changes into plain English descriptions:

- `+ showWelcomeMessage = true` → "Welcome message now displays when app starts"
- Deleted login retry logic → "Removed automatic login retry"

### Step 4: Consolidate Changes

Groups related changes and eliminates noise:

- If a feature was added then removed, it's not mentioned
- If a value changed multiple times, only the final state matters
- Related commits are merged into single descriptions

### Step 5: Categorize

Assigns each change to the appropriate bucket based on:

- Commit message keywords (feat, fix, enhancement, etc.)
- Type of code change (new files = feature, deleted code = removal)
- Breaking change indicators

### Step 6: Format Output

Generates clean markdown with:

- Clear category headings
- Brief bullet points
- Optional footnotes for important notes
- No technical details, secrets, or jargon

## Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Tags**: Tag releases with semantic versions (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
2. **Run Before Release**: Generate notes as part of your release process
3. **Review Output**: AI interpretation is good but human review ensures accuracy
4. **Add Footnotes**: Use the notes section for setup instructions or warnings
5. **Keep It Brief**: Bullet points should be one line each
6. **No Secrets**: Never include passwords, API keys, or internal URLs in notes

## Limitations

- **Requires Git Repository**: Only works with valid git repos
- **Tag Must Exist**: Specified tags must exist in the repository
- **Diff Size Limits**: Very large diffs (1000+ files) may be summarized
- **Language Detection**: Best results with common programming languages
- **Interpretation Accuracy**: Complex changes may need human refinement
- **No Real-Time**: Analyzes existing commits, not live changes

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for:**

- Release announcements to support teams (Slack)
- Customer-facing changelog updates
- Sprint review summaries
- Version upgrade documentation
- Non-technical stakeholder updates

**Not Ideal for:**

- Technical developer documentation
- Detailed code review
- Security audit reports
- Debugging commit history
