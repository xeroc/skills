# Example Prompts

Use these prompts when you want the SEO skill to run with clear scope, evidence requirements, and expected outputs. Replace placeholders such as `<url>`, `<domain>`, `<repo>`, `<keyword>`, and `<competitor>` before running.

## Prompt Pattern

A strong SEO prompt usually includes:

- Target: domain, page URL, article URL, or GitHub repository.
- Scope: full audit, technical SEO, schema, content, performance, links, GEO/AEO, or GitHub SEO.
- Evidence requirement: ask for specific proof from HTML, scripts, screenshots, APIs, or crawl data.
- Output format: ask for prioritized fixes, confidence labels, and report artifacts.
- Constraints: mention API limits, credentials, crawl depth, or pages to exclude when needed.

Example structure:

```text
Run <audit type> for <target>.
Use direct page evidence and bundled scripts where available.
Label every finding as Confirmed, Likely, or Hypothesis.
Prioritize fixes by impact and effort.
Create FULL-AUDIT-REPORT.md and ACTION-PLAN.md.
```

## Full Website Audit

Use this when you want the broadest site-level review.

```text
Run a full SEO audit for <domain>.

Scope:
- Crawl representative pages from the homepage, sitemap, and internal links.
- Check robots.txt, sitemap quality, indexability, canonicals, redirects, status codes, security headers, Core Web Vitals, schema, content quality, internal links, image SEO, GEO, and AEO.
- Use bundled scripts for evidence where execution is available.

Output:
- Create FULL-AUDIT-REPORT.md with findings grouped by Technical SEO, Content, Schema, Performance, Links, Images, GEO/AEO, and Unknowns.
- Create ACTION-PLAN.md with prioritized fixes sorted by impact and effort.
- For every finding, include Evidence, Impact, Fix, Severity, and Confidence.
- Do not treat API rate limits or blocked fetches as confirmed site issues.
```

## Single Page Audit

Use this for one important URL such as a homepage, product page, landing page, or service page.

```text
Run a single-page SEO audit for <url>.

Check:
- Title, meta description, canonical, robots directives, headings, internal links, schema, social metadata, images, readability, E-E-A-T, Core Web Vitals, and mobile rendering risks.
- Compare the visible page intent against this target query: <keyword>.

Output:
- Start with the top 10 highest-impact fixes.
- Include exact HTML or script evidence for each issue.
- Separate quick fixes from engineering fixes.
- Include a recommended title tag, meta description, H1, and schema improvements if needed.
```

## Blog Post or Article Audit

Use this when optimizing editorial content.

```text
Analyze this article for SEO, E-E-A-T, and answer readiness: <article-url>.

Target keyword: <keyword>
Search intent: <informational/commercial/investigational/local>

Review:
- Title, slug, meta description, H1/H2 structure, intro clarity, topical coverage, freshness, author signals, citations, internal links, image alt text, Article/BlogPosting schema, and answer-block formatting.
- Identify missing sections that would help satisfy search intent.
- Check whether the article can answer featured snippets, People Also Ask style questions, and AI answer citations.

Output:
- Give a rewrite plan for the title, meta description, intro, headings, FAQ-style answer blocks, and internal links.
- Include a content gap table with Missing Topic, Why It Matters, Suggested Section, and Priority.
- Label findings as Confirmed, Likely, or Hypothesis.
```

## Technical SEO Deep Dive

Use this when crawlability and indexability are the priority.

```text
Run a technical SEO audit for <domain>.

Focus on:
- robots.txt, AI crawler policies, XML sitemaps, canonical tags, noindex/nofollow directives, X-Robots-Tag headers, redirect chains, HTTP status codes, duplicate metadata, URL quality, crawl depth, orphan candidates, JavaScript rendering risks, mobile viewport, and security headers.

Use scripts where available:
- robots_checker.py
- sitemap_checker.py
- crawl_audit.py
- indexability_matrix.py
- redirect_checker.py
- x_robots_header_checker.py
- security_headers.py
- javascript_render_audit.py

Output:
- Produce an indexability matrix with URL, status, robots, meta robots, x-robots, canonical, sitemap presence, verdict, and fix.
- Prioritize issues that block crawling, indexing, rendering, or canonical consolidation.
```

## Schema Audit and JSON-LD Generation

Use this when structured data matters.

```text
Audit Schema.org markup for <url>.

Check:
- Existing JSON-LD syntax, @type choices, required properties, recommended properties, deprecated schema types, restricted rich result types, placeholder values, duplicate schema, and conflicts between page content and structured data.

Output:
- List existing schema types and validation issues.
- Explain whether each issue affects eligibility, trust, or enhancement quality.
- Generate corrected JSON-LD that matches the visible page content.
- Use JSON-LD only. Do not recommend Microdata or RDFa.
```

## Core Web Vitals and Performance

Use this when speed, UX, and CWV are the focus.

```text
Run Core Web Vitals and performance analysis for <url>.

Check:
- LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB, render-blocking resources, image weight, likely LCP image behavior, lazy loading mistakes, third-party scripts, cache headers, compression, font loading, and mobile rendering risks.

Output:
- Break down LCP into TTFB, resource delay, resource duration, and render delay where data allows.
- Separate lab data, field data, and unknowns.
- Give implementation-specific fixes for images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, caching, and third-party scripts.
- If PageSpeed is rate-limited, continue with local evidence and mark affected findings as Hypothesis.
```

## Content Quality and E-E-A-T

Use this when content trust, helpfulness, and topical depth are weak points.

```text
Review content quality and E-E-A-T signals for <url>.
