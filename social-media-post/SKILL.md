# Social Media Post Generator Skill

Generate platform-optimized social media posts using algorithm insights and best practices.

**Note**: This is a LOCAL skill for Navigator marketing only. NOT included in the plugin distribution.

## When to Invoke

Auto-invoke when user says:
- "Create a Threads post about [topic]"
- "Write a social media post for [announcement]"
- "Generate X post for [feature]"
- "Create LinkedIn announcement for [release]"
- "Write Threads post like option 5"

## What This Does

**Platform-Specific Workflow**:
1. **Analyze Content**: Extract key points, features, value propositions
2. **Apply Platform Rules**: Character limits, formatting, hashtag strategies
3. **Optimize for Algorithm**: Engagement tactics, timing recommendations
4. **Generate Variants**: Multiple options (short, medium, detailed)
5. **Include Metadata**: Character count, hashtag suggestions, posting time

**Platforms Supported**: Threads, X (Twitter), LinkedIn

---

## Platform Specifications

### Threads (Instagram)

**Character Limits**:
- Standard post: 500 characters
- Long-form (with attachment): 10,000 characters
- Display: Shows "Read more" after ~500 chars

**Formatting**:
✅ Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
✅ Emojis (count toward limit)
✅ Bullet points (using • or -)
✅ Line breaks
❌ No hashtags in Threads (algorithm ignores them)
❌ No clickable links in body (use link preview)

**Media**:
- Images: Up to 10 per post
- Video: Up to 5 minutes
- Link previews: Automatic from URLs

**Algorithm Priorities** (2025):
1. **Engagement** (40%): Likes, comments, shares, reply views
2. **Recency** (30%): Fresh content gets priority
3. **Interest/Relevance** (20%): Based on user's past interactions
4. **Profile Visits** (10%): Likelihood user will click profile

**Best Practices**:
✅ Conversational, authentic tone (not corporate)
✅ Ask open-ended questions
✅ Create discussions, not announcements
✅ Post consistently (1-3x daily)
✅ Use visuals (images/videos boost engagement)
✅ Respond to comments within 1 hour
❌ No direct cross-posts from Instagram/X
❌ Avoid promotional language
❌ No hashtags (they don't work on Threads)

**Optimal Posting Times** (US audience):
- Monday-Friday: 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM, 7-9 PM ET
- Saturday-Sunday: 10 AM-2 PM ET

**Content That Works**:
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Quick tips and tricks
- Relatable experiences
- Open-ended questions
- Industry discussions
- Memes (if relevant)

---

### X (Twitter)

**Character Limits**:
- Standard tweet: 280 characters
- Premium (Blue): 25,000 characters (displays with "Show more")

**Formatting**:
✅ Emojis
✅ Line breaks (use intentionally)
✅ Mentions (@username)
✅ Hashtags (max 2-3 per tweet)
❌ No rich text formatting

**Media**:
- Images: Up to 4 per tweet
- Video: Up to 2:20 (standard), 10 min (Blue)
- GIFs: 1 per tweet

**Algorithm Priorities** (2025):
1. **Engagement rate** (likes, retweets, replies)
2. **Recency** (fresh tweets prioritized)
3. **Media** (tweets with images/video perform better)
4. **Authenticity** (verified accounts, genuine engagement)

**Best Practices**:
✅ Front-load important info (first 100 chars)
✅ Use line breaks for readability
✅ 1-2 hashtags max (more hurts engagement)
✅ Include visual (image/video)
✅ Tag relevant accounts (when appropriate)
✅ Tweet threads for detailed content
❌ Don't overuse hashtags (looks spammy)
❌ Avoid link-only tweets (add context)

**Optimal Posting Times** (US audience):
- Monday-Friday: 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM ET
- Saturday-Sunday: 9 AM-12 PM ET

---

✅ Numbered lists
❌ No official rich text (use workarounds)

3. **Relevance** (to user's network and interests)
4. **Personal connections** (1st-degree connections prioritized)

**Best Practices**:
✅ Professional but authentic tone

   - Under 280 chars (X-compatible)
   - Emoji bullets
   - Clear value props
   - Direct CTA

2. **Medium Detailed**
   - 300-500 chars (Threads standard)
   - More context

   - Conversation starter

3. **Long-Form** (Threads attachment / LinkedIn)
   - 800-1500 chars
   - Full story/context
   - Multiple sections
   - Rich formatting

---

### Step 4: Add Metadata

For each variant, include:

```markdown
**Platform**: Threads
**Character Count**: 287/500
**Estimated Engagement**: High (question + visual + emojis)
**Hashtags**: None (Threads doesn't use hashtags)
**Media Suggestion**: Screenshot of update command
**Best Time to Post**: Tuesday 9-11 AM ET

## Best Practices by Platform

### Threads
1. **Be conversational**: Avoid corporate speak
2. **Ask questions**: Drive engagement with open-ended questions
3. **No hashtags**: They don't work on Threads
4. **Respond fast**: Reply to comments within 1 hour
5. **Post consistently**: 1-3x daily for best reach
6. **Use visuals**: Images/videos boost engagement significantly
7. **Tell stories**: Personal experiences > announcements

### X (Twitter)
1. **Front-load value**: First 100 chars matter most
2. **Use threads**: Break complex topics into digestible tweets
3. **Limit hashtags**: 1-2 max, more hurts engagement
4. **Add media**: Tweets with images get 150% more engagement
5. **Be concise**: Shorter tweets (200-250 chars) perform better
6. **Time it right**: Post during work hours for tech audience

### LinkedIn
1. **Hook early**: First 2 lines show in feed, make them count
2. **Be professional**: But still authentic and relatable
3. **Use data**: Statistics and metrics boost credibility
4. **Tell stories**: Case studies and experiences resonate
5. **Engage back**: Comment on posts in your niche
6. **Post less, quality more**: 2-5x per week is optimal
