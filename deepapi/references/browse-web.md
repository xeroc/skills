# Browse Web — DeepAPI Endpoint Reference

Generated endpoint reference for the `browse-web` rows of the `deepapi` skill router. Bundle version: c5a387bc96e1. This file is always managed — it is refreshed with the bundle even when `../SKILL.md` has been customized.

Shared protocol (environment, auth, idempotency, dry-run, polling, and error handling) lives in `../SKILL.md`. This file carries the full per-endpoint detail.

## Workflow Guidance

Use browser automation only when the outcome requires interaction with a public website.

### Recommended workflow

1. Prefer the scraping workflow for static reading and extraction.
2. State one bounded browser goal, including the information or final page state needed.
3. Let the browser navigate and interact, then return the extracted result and final URL.
4. Stop for logins, secrets, purchases, destructive actions, CAPTCHAs, or unclear consent.

## Endpoint Details

## Browser Task

`POST /v1/browser/act`

Give a real cloud browser a plain-English goal and get the result back. Built for pages an agent has to operate, not just read: filters and sortable tables, JavaScript pagination, dropdowns, date pickers and sliders, iframes and shadow DOM, infinite scroll, site search, store locators, and comparing several pages in one run. Public web only — no logins, purchases, or CAPTCHA solving.

- Capability: `browser.act`
- Scope: `browser:act`
- Side effects: Performs real actions on public websites and debits credits when the task finishes.
- Cost: Defaults to maxCostUsd 1.25. Finished tasks are billed per attempt, including tasks with isSuccess false. Failed and stopped tasks are free. Typical price: ~$0.125-$0.75 per task depending on steps.
- Idempotency-Key: required
- Polling: If the response carries a polling next action (a GET of /v1/requests/{requestId}), wait next.afterSecs and call it. Keep following that polling next while it is present, even when status is already succeeded (a settling run returns succeeded with output null and a polling next). The result is final when no polling next remains or status is failed. Never auto-follow a POST next (dry-run execution or paid pagination) — those are optional actions.

Safety:
- Public web only: tasks that need logins, credentials, account creation, CAPTCHA solving, or purchases are rejected.
- Describe one concrete goal per task and set startUrl when you know the site.
